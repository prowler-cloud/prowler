The private endpoint is the internal IP address of the master, behind an internal load balancer in the master's wirtual network. Nodes communicate with the master using the private endpoint. The public endpoint enables the Kubernetes API to be accessed from outside the master's virtual network. Although Kubernetes API requires an authorized token to perform sensitive actions, a vulnerability could potentially expose the Kubernetes publically with unrestricted access. Additionally, an attacker may be able to identify the current cluster and Kubernetes API version and determine whether it is vulnerable to an attack. Unless required, disabling public endpoint will help prevent such threats, and require the attacker to be on the master's virtual network to perform any attack on the Kubernetes API.;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/private-clusters?tabs=azure-portal;To use a private endpoint, create a new private endpoint in your virtual network then create a link between your virtual network and a new private DNS zone;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/access-private-cluster?tabs=azure-cli;;;az aks update -n <cluster_name> -g <resource_group> --disable-public-fqdn;;ENS-RD2022: mp.com.4.az.aks.2 | MITRE-ATTACK: T1190, T1530;;;;;<prowler_version>;https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/azure-ad-rbac | https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/concepts-identity

The principle of least privilege should be applied to how traffic can flow between pods in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. Let's say you likely want to block traffic directly to back-end applications. The Network Policy feature in Kubernetes lets you define rules for ingress and egress traffic between pods in a cluster.;All pods in an AKS cluster can send and receive traffic without limitations, by default. To improve security, you can define rules that control the flow of traffic. Back-end applications are often only exposed to required front-end services, for example. Or, database components are only accessible to the application tiers that connect to them. Network Policy is a Kubernetes specification that defines access policies for communication between Pods. Using Network Policies, you define an ordered set of rules to send and receive traffic and apply them to a collection of pods that match one or more label selectors. These network policy rules are defined as YAML manifests. Network policies can be included as part of a wider manifest that also creates a deployment or service.;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v2-network-security#ns-2-connect-private-networks-together;;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-network-policies;;https://docs.prowler.com/checks/azure/azure-kubernetes-policies/bc_azr_kubernetes_4#terraform;;;ENS-RD2022: mp.com.4.r2.az.aks.1;;;;Network Policy requires the Network Policy add-on. This add-on is included automatically when a cluster with Network Policy is created, but for an existing cluster, needs to be added prior to enabling Network Policy. Enabling/Disabling Network Policy causes a rolling update of all cluster nodes, similar to performing a cluster upgrade. This operation is long-running and will block other operations on the cluster (including delete) until it has run to completion. If Network Policy is used, a cluster must have at least 2 nodes of type n1-standard-1 or higher. The recommended minimum size cluster to run Network Policy enforcement is 3 n1-standard-1 instances. Enabling Network Policy enforcement consumes additional resources in nodes. Specifically, it increases the memory footprint of the kube-system process by approximately 128MB, and requires approximately 300 millicores of CPU.;<prowler_version>;https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/azure-ad-rbac | https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/concepts-identity
