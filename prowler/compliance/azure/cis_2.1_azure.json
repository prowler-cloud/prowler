          "RationaleStatement": "Defining trusted source IP addresses or ranges helps organizations create and enforce Conditional Access policies around those trusted or untrusted IP addresses and ranges.

          "ImpactStatement": "When configuring `Named locations`, the organization can create locations using Geographical location data or by defining source IP addresses or ranges. Configuring `Named locations` using a Country location does not provide the organization the ability to mark those locations as trusted, and any Conditional Access policy relying on those `Countries location` setting will not be able to use the `All trusted locations` setting within the Conditional Access policy. They instead will have to rely on the `Select locations` setting. This may add additional resource requirements when configuring, and will require thorough organizational testing.  In general, Conditional Access policies may completely prevent users from authenticating to Microsoft Entra ID, and thorough testing is recommended. To avoid complete lockout, a 'Break Glass' account with full Global Administrator rights is recommended in the event all other administrators are locked out of authenticating to Microsoft Entra ID. This 'Break Glass' account should be excluded from Conditional Access Policies and should be configured with the longest pass phrase feasible. This account should only be used in the event of an emergency and complete administrator lockout.",

From Azure Home open the portal menu in the top left, and select `Microsoft Entra ID`. 1. Scroll down in the menu on the left, and select `Security`. 1. Select on the left side `Conditional Access`. 1. Click the `+ New policy` button, then: 1. Provide a name for the policy.  1. Under `Assignments`, select `Users or workload identities` then:  - Under `Include`, select `All users`  - Under `Exclude`, check Users and groups and only select emergency access accounts and service accounts (**NOTE**: Service accounts are excluded here because service accounts are non-interactive and cannot complete MFA) 1. Under `Assignments`, select `Cloud apps or actions` then:  - Under `Include`, select `All cloud apps`  - Leave `Exclude` blank unless you have a well defined exception 1. Under `Conditions`, select `Locations` then:  - Select `Include`, then add entries for locations for those that should be **blocked**  - Select `Exclude`, then add entries for those that should be allowed (**IMPORTANT**: Ensure that all Trusted Locations are in the `Exclude` list.) 1. Under `Access Controls`, select `Grant` and Confirm that `Block Access` is selected. 1. Set `Enable policy` to `Report-only`. 1. Click `Create`.  **NOTE:** The policy is not yet 'live,' since `Report-only` is being used to audit the effect of the policy.  Part 2 of 2 - Confirm that the policy is not blocking access that should be granted, then toggle to `On`. 1. With your policy now in report-only mode, return to the Microsoft Entra blade and click on `Sign-in logs`. 1. Review the recent sign-in events - click an event then review the event details (specifically the `Report-only` tab) to ensure:  - The sign-in event you're reviewing occurred **after** turning on the policy in report-only mode  - The policy name from step 5 above is listed in the `Policy Name` column  - The `Result` column for the new policy shows that the policy was `Not applied` (indicating the location origin was not blocked) 1.

          "Description": "Resource Logs capture activity to the data access plane while the Activity log is a subscription-level log for the control plane. Resource-level diagnostic logs provide insight into operations that were performed within that resource itself; for example, reading or updating a secret from a Key Vault. Currently, 95 Azure resources support Azure Monitoring (See the more information section for a complete list), including Network Security Groups, Load Balancers, Key Vault, AD, Logic Apps, and CosmosDB. The content of these logs varies by resource type.  A number of back-end services were not configured to log and store Resource Logs for certain activities or for a sufficient length. It is crucial that monitoring is correctly configured to log all relevant activities and retain those logs for a sufficient length of time. Given that the mean time to detection in an enterprise is 240 days, a minimum retention period of two years is recommended.",
          "RationaleStatement": "A lack of monitoring reduces the visibility into the data plane, and therefore an organization's ability to detect reconnaissance, authorization attempts or other malicious activity. Unlike Activity Logs, Resource Logs are not enabled by default. Specifically, without monitoring it would be impossible to tell which entities had accessed a data store that was breached. In addition, alerts for failed attempts to access APIs for Web Services or Databases are only possible when logging is enabled.",
          "ImpactStatement": "Costs for monitoring varies with Log Volume. Not every resource needs to have logging enabled. It is important to determine the security classification of the data being processed by the given resource and adjust the logging based on which events need to be tracked. This is typically determined by governance and compliance requirements.",
          "RemediationProcedure": "Azure Subscriptions should log every access and operation for all resources. Logs should be sent to Storage and a Log Analytics Workspace or equivalent third-party system. Logs should be kept in readily-accessible storage for a minimum of one year, and then moved to inexpensive cold storage for a duration of time as necessary. If retention policies are set but storing logs in a Storage Account is disabled (for example, if only Event Hubs or Log Analytics options are selected), the retention policies have no effect. Enable all monitoring at first, and then be more aggressive moving data to cold storage if the volume of data becomes a cost concern.  **From Azure Portal**  The specific steps for configuring resources within the Azure console vary depending on resource, but typically the steps are:  1.

          "Description": "Resource Manager Locks provide a way for administrators to lock down Azure resources to prevent deletion of, or modifications to, a resource. These locks sit outside of the Role Based Access Controls (RBAC) hierarchy and, when applied, will place restrictions on the resource for all users. These locks are very useful when there is an important resource in a subscription that users should not be able to delete or change. Locks can help prevent accidental and malicious changes or deletion.",
          "RationaleStatement": "As an administrator, it may be necessary to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource to prevent other users in the organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources. The lock level can be set to to `CanNotDelete` or `ReadOnly` to achieve this purpose.  - `CanNotDelete` means authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they cannot delete the resource.  - `ReadOnly` means authorized users can read a resource, but they cannot delete or update the resource. Applying this lock is similar to restricting all authorized users to the permissions granted by the Reader role.",
          "ImpactStatement": "There can be unintended outcomes of locking a resource. Applying a lock to a parent service will cause it to be inherited by all resources within. Conversely, applying a lock to a resource may not apply to connected storage, leaving it unlocked. Please see the documentation for further information.",
