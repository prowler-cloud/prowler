          "RationaleStatement": "Defining trusted source IP addresses or ranges helps organizations create and enforce Conditional Access policies around those trusted or untrusted IP addresses and ranges.

          "ImpactStatement": "When configuring `Named locations`, the organization can create locations using Geographical location data or by defining source IP addresses or ranges. Configuring `Named locations` using a Country location does not provide the organization the ability to mark those locations as trusted, and any Conditional Access policy relying on those `Countries location` setting will not be able to use the `All trusted locations` setting within the Conditional Access policy. They instead will have to rely on the `Select locations` setting. This may add additional resource requirements when configuring and will require thorough organizational testing.In general, Conditional Access policies may completely prevent users from authenticating to Microsoft Entra ID, and thorough testing is recommended. To avoid complete lockout, a 'Break Glass' account with full Global Administrator rights is recommended in the event all other administrators are locked out of authenticating to Microsoft Entra ID. This 'Break Glass' account should be excluded from Conditional Access Policies and should be configured with the longest pass phrase feasible in addition to a FIDO2 security key or certificate kept in a very secure physical location. This account should only be used in the event of an emergency and complete administrator lockout.**NOTE:** Starting July 2024, Microsoft will begin requiring MFA for All Users - including Break Glass Accounts. By the end of October 2024, this requirement will be enforced. Physical FIDO2 security keys, or a certificate kept on secure removable storage can fulfill this MFA requirement.

The larger the attack surface, the harder it is to protect.This tool can be configured to scan your organization's online infrastructure such as specified domains, hosts, CIDR blocks, and SSL certificates, and store them in an Inventory. Inventory items can be added, reviewed, approved, and removed, and may contain enrichments ('insights') and additional information collected from the tool's different scan engines and open-source intelligence sources.A Defender EASM workspace will generate an Inventory of publicly exposed assets by crawling and scanning the internet using _Seeds_ you provide when setting up the tool. Seeds can be FQDNs, IP CIDR blocks, and WHOIS records.Defender EASM will generate Insights within 24-48 hours after Seeds are provided, and these insights include vulnerability data (CVEs), ports and protocols, and weak or expired SSL certificates that could be used by an attacker for reconnaisance or exploitation.Results are classified High/Medium/Low and some of them include proposed mitigations.",

Estimated cost is not provided within the tool, and users are strongly advised to contact their Microsoft sales representative for pricing and set a calendar reminder for the end of the trial period. For an EASM workspace having an Inventory of 5k-10k billable items (IP addresses, hostnames, SSL certificates, etc) a typical cost might be approximiately $85-170 per day or $2500-5000 USD/month at the time of publication.If the workspace is deleted by the last day of a free trial period, no charges are billed.",

Please ensure the prerequisite recommendation has been implemented before proceeding: - Ensure Default Network Access Rule for Storage Accounts is Set to DenySome Azure services that interact with storage accounts operate from networks that can't be granted access through network rules. To help this type of service work as intended, allow the set of trusted Azure services to bypass the network rules. These services will then use strong authentication to access the storage account. If the `Allow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this storage account` exception is enabled, the following services are granted access to the storage account: Azure Backup, Azure Data Box, Azure DevTest Labs, Azure Event Grid, Azure Event Hubs, Azure File Sync, Azure HDInsight, Azure Import/Export, Azure Monitor, Azure Networking Services, and Azure Site Recovery (when registered in the subscription).",
          "RationaleStatement": "Turning on firewall rules for a storage account will block access to incoming requests for data, including from other Azure services. We can re-enable this functionality by allowing access to `trusted Azure services` through networking exceptions.",
          "ImpactStatement": "This creates authentication credentials for services that need access to storage resources so that services will no longer need to communicate via network request.

Resource-level diagnostic logs provide insight into operations that were performed within that resource itself; for example, reading or updating a secret from a Key Vault. Currently, 95 Azure resources support Azure Monitoring (See the more information section for a complete list), including Network Security Groups, Load Balancers, Key Vault, AD, Logic Apps, and CosmosDB. The content of these logs varies by resource type.A number of back-end services were not configured to log and store Resource Logs for certain activities or for a sufficient length. It is crucial that monitoring is correctly configured to log all relevant activities and retain those logs for a sufficient length of time. Given that the mean time to detection in an enterprise is 240 days, a minimum retention period of two years is recommended.",

Unlike Activity Logs, Resource Logs are not enabled by default. Specifically, without monitoring it would be impossible to tell which entities had accessed a data store that was breached. In addition, alerts for failed attempts to access APIs for Web Services or Databases are only possible when logging is enabled.",

If retention policies are set but storing logs in a Storage Account is disabled (for example, if only Event Hubs or Log Analytics options are selected), the retention policies have no effect.

          "Description": "Azure Key Vault will store multiple types of sensitive information such as encryption keys, certificate thumbprints, and Managed Identity Credentials. Access to these 'Secrets' can be controlled through granular permissions.",
          "RationaleStatement": "The credentials given to an application have permissions to create, delete, or modify data stored within the systems they access. If these credentials are stored within the application itself, anyone with access to the application or a copy of the code has access to them. Storing within Azure Key Vault as secrets increases security by controlling access. This also allows for updates of the credentials without redeploying the entire application.",
          "ImpactStatement": "Integrating references to secrets within the key vault are required to be specifically integrated within the application code. This will require additional configuration to be made during the writing of an application, or refactoring of an already written one.

Remote debugging opens a communication channel that can be exploited by attackers. By disabling it, you reduce the number of potential entry points for unauthorized access.If remote debugging is enabled without proper access controls, it can allow unauthorized users to connect to your application, potentially leading to data breaches or malicious code execution.During a remote debugging session, sensitive information might be exposed. Disabling remote debugging helps ensure that such data remains secure. This minimizes the use of remote access tools to reduce risk.",

These locks sit outside of the Role Based Access Controls (RBAC) hierarchy and, when applied, will place restrictions on the resource for all users. These locks are very useful when there is an important resource in a subscription that users should not be able to delete or change. Locks can help prevent accidental and malicious changes or deletion.",

The lock level can be set to to `CanNotDelete` or `ReadOnly` to achieve this purpose.- `CanNotDelete` means authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they cannot delete the resource.- `ReadOnly` means authorized users can read a resource, but they cannot delete or update the resource. Applying this lock is similar to restricting all authorized users to the permissions granted by the Reader role.",
