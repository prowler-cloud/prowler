          "ImpactStatement": "When configuring `Named locations`, the organization can create locations using Geographical location data or by defining source IP addresses or ranges. Configuring `Named locations` using a Country location does not provide the organization the ability to mark those locations as trusted, and any Conditional Access policy relying on those `Countries location` setting will not be able to use the `All trusted locations` setting within the Conditional Access policy. They instead will have to rely on the `Select locations` setting. This may add additional resource requirements when configuring and will require thorough organizational testing.  In general, Conditional Access policies may completely prevent users from authenticating to Microsoft Entra ID, and thorough testing is recommended. To avoid complete lockout, a 'Break Glass' account with full Global Administrator rights is recommended in the event all other administrators are locked out of authenticating to Microsoft Entra ID. This 'Break Glass' account should be excluded from Conditional Access Policies and should be configured with the longest pass phrase feasible in addition to a FIDO2 security key or certificate kept in a very secure physical location. This account should only be used in the event of an emergency and complete administrator lockout.  **NOTE:** Starting July 2024, Microsoft will begin requiring MFA for All Users - including Break Glass Accounts. By the end of October 2024, this requirement will be enforced. Physical FIDO2 security keys, or a certificate kept on secure removable storage can fulfill this MFA requirement.

Under `Assignments`, select `Users` then:  - Under `Include`, select `All users`  - Under `Exclude`, check Users and groups and only select emergency access accounts and service accounts (**NOTE**: Service accounts are excluded here because service accounts are non-interactive and cannot complete MFA) 1. Under `Assignments`, select `Target resources` then:  - Under `Include`, select `All cloud apps`  - Leave `Exclude` blank unless you have a well defined exception 1. Under `Conditions`, select `Locations` then:  - Select `Include`, then add entries for locations for those that should be **blocked**  - Select `Exclude`, then add entries for those that should be allowed (**IMPORTANT**: Ensure that all Trusted Locations are in the `Exclude` list.) 1. Under `Access Controls`, select `Grant` select `Block Access`. 1. Set `Enable policy` to `Report-only`. 1. Click `Create`.  Allow some time to pass to ensure the sign-in logs capture relevant conditional access events. These events will need to be reviewed to determine if additional considerations are necessary for your organization (e.g. legitimate locations are being blocked and investigation is needed for exception).  **NOTE:** The policy is not yet 'live,' since `Report-only` is being used to audit the effect of the policy.  Part 2 of 2 - Confirm that the policy is not blocking access that should be granted, then toggle to `On`. 1. With your policy now in report-only mode, return to the Microsoft Entra blade and click on `Sign-in logs`. 1. Review the recent sign-in events - click an event then review the event details (specifically the `Report-only` tab) to ensure:  - The sign-in event you're reviewing occurred **after** turning on the policy in report-only mode  - The policy name from step 6 above is listed in the `Policy Name` column  - The `Result` column for the new policy shows that the policy was `Not applied` (indicating the location origin was not blocked) 1. If the above conditions are present, navigate back to the policy name in Conditional Access and open it. 1. Toggle the policy from `Report-only` to `On`. 1. Click `Save`.  **Remediate from PowerShell**  First, set up the conditions objects values before updating an existing conditional access policy or before creating a new one. You may need to use additional PowerShell cmdlets to retrieve specific IDs such as the `Get-MgIdentityConditionalAccessNamedLocation` which outputs the `Location IDs` for use with conditional access policies.  ``` $conditions = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.MSGraph.Model.ConditionalAccessConditionSet  $conditions.Applications = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.MSGraph.Model.ConditionalAccessApplicationCondition $conditions.Applications.IncludeApplications = <All | Office365 | app ID | @(app ID 1, app ID 2, etc...> $conditions.Applications.ExcludeApplications = <Office365 | app ID | @(app ID 1, app ID 2, etc...)>  $conditions.Users = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.MSGraph.Model.ConditionalAccessUserCondition $conditions.Users.IncludeUsers = <All | None | GuestsOrExternalUsers | Specific User ID | @(User ID 1, User ID 2, etc.)> $conditions.Users.ExcludeUsers = <GuestsOrExternalUsers | Specific User ID | @(User ID 1, User ID 2, etc.)> $conditions.Users.IncludeGroups = <group ID | All | @(Group ID 1, Group ID 2, etc...)> $conditions.Users.ExcludeGroups = <group ID | @(Group ID 1, Group ID 2, etc...)> $conditions.Users.IncludeRoles = <Role ID | All | @(Role ID 1, Role ID 2, etc...)> $conditions.Users.ExcludeRoles = <Role ID | @(Role ID 1, Role ID 2, etc...)>  $conditions.Locations = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.MSGraph.Model.ConditionalAccessLocationCondition $conditions.Locations.IncludeLocations = <Location ID | @(Location ID 1, Location ID 2, etc...) > $conditions.Locations.ExcludeLocations = <AllTrusted | Location ID | @(Location ID 1, Location ID 2, etc...)>  $controls = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.MSGraph.Model.ConditionalAccessGrantControls $controls._Operator = OR $controls.BuiltInControls = block ```  Next, update the existing conditional access policy with the condition set options configured with the previous commands.  ``` Update-MgIdentityConditionalAccessPolicy -PolicyId <policy ID> -Conditions $conditions -GrantControls $controls ```  To create a new conditional access policy that complies with this best practice, run the following commands after creating the condition set above  ``` New-MgIdentityConditionalAccessPolicy -Name Policy Name -State <enabled|disabled> -Conditions $conditions -GrantControls $controls ```",

Currently, 95 Azure resources support Azure Monitoring (See the more information section for a complete list), including Network Security Groups, Load Balancers, Key Vault, AD, Logic Apps, and CosmosDB. The content of these logs varies by resource type.  A number of back-end services were not configured to log and store Resource Logs for certain activities or for a sufficient length. It is crucial that monitoring is correctly configured to log all relevant activities and retain those logs for a sufficient length of time. Given that the mean time to detection in an enterprise is 240 days, a minimum retention period of two years is recommended.",
          "RationaleStatement": "A lack of monitoring reduces the visibility into the data plane, and therefore an organization's ability to detect reconnaissance, authorization attempts or other malicious activity. Unlike Activity Logs, Resource Logs are not enabled by default. Specifically, without monitoring it would be impossible to tell which entities had accessed a data store that was breached. In addition, alerts for failed attempts to access APIs for Web Services or Databases are only possible when logging is enabled.",
          "ImpactStatement": "Costs for monitoring varies with Log Volume. Not every resource needs to have logging enabled. It is important to determine the security classification of the data being processed by the given resource and adjust the logging based on which events need to be tracked.

To do this, the private endpoint uses an IP address from the VNet for each service. Network traffic between disparate services securely traverses encrypted over the VNet. This VNet can also link addressing space, extending your network and accessing resources on it. Similarly, it can be a tunnel through public networks to connect remote infrastructures together. This creates further security through segmenting network traffic and preventing outside sources from accessing it.",
