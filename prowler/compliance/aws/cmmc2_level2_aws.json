    "Description": "CMMC 2.0 Level 2, known as 'Advanced Cyber Hygiene,' is intended for organizations that handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). It serves as a transitional level between the foundational practices of Level 1 and the advanced practices of Level 3. Level 2 includes 110 practices, aligning closely with the NIST SP 800-171 framework. These practices focus on enhancing cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive information against a range of threats. AWS offers a robust suite of services to assist organizations in achieving CMMC 2.0 Level 2 compliance, helping to ensure that all necessary security controls are implemented effectively.",

Changing the access keys on a regular schedule is a security best practice. It shortens the period an access key is active and reduces the business impact if the keys are compromised. This rule requires an access key rotation value (Config Default: 90). The actual value should reflect your organization's policies.",
