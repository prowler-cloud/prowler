This makes it easier to manage access across multiple applications and services, because you are creating, managing, and revoking access from a single location. For example, if someone leaves your organization, you can revoke access for all applications and services (including AWS) from one location. This reduces the need for multiple credentials and provides an opportunity to integrate with existing human resources (HR) processes. For federation with individual AWS accounts, you can use centralized identities for AWS with a SAML 2.0-based provider with AWS Identity and Access Management. You can use any provider— whether hosted by you in AWS, external to AWS, or supplied by the AWS Partner—that is compatible with the SAML 2.0 protocol. You can use federation between your AWS account and your chosen provider to grant a user or application access to call AWS API operations by using a SAML assertion to get temporary security credentials. Web-based single sign-on is also supported, allowing users to sign in to the AWS Management Console from your sign in website. For federation to multiple accounts in your AWS Organizations, you can configure your identity source in AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) (IAM Identity Center), and specify where your users and groups are stored. Once configured, your identity provider is your source of truth, and information can be synchronized using the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) v2.0 protocol. You can then look up users or groups and grant them IAM Identity Center access to AWS accounts, cloud applications, or both. IAM Identity Center integrates with AWS Organizations, which enables you to configure your identity provider once and then grant access to existing and new accounts managed in your organization. IAM Identity Center provides you with a default store, which you can use to manage your users and groups. If you choose to use the IAM Identity Center store, create your users and groups and assign their level of access to your AWS accounts and applications, keeping in mind the best practice of least privilege. Alternatively, you can choose to Connect to Your External Identity Provider using SAML 2.0, or Connect to Your Microsoft AD Directory using AWS Directory Service. Once configured, you can sign into the AWS Management Console, or the AWS mobile app, by authenticating through your central identity provider. For managing end-users or consumers of your workloads, such as a mobile app, you can use Amazon Cognito. It provides authentication, authorization, and user management for your web and mobile apps.

For human identities, you should require users to change their passwords periodically and retire access keys in favor of temporary credentials.

Periodic validation, preferably through an automated tool, is necessary to verify that the correct controls are enforced. For human identities, you should require users to change their passwords periodically and retire access keys in favor of temporary credentials. As you are moving from users to centralized identities, you can generate a credential report to audit your users. We also recommend that you enforce MFA settings in your identity provider. You can set up AWS Config Rules to monitor these settings. For machine identities, you should rely on temporary credentials using IAM roles. For situations where this is not possible, frequent auditing and rotating access keys is necessary.",

However, simply analyzing collected data and manually processing information is insufficient to keep up with the volume of information flowing from complex architectures. Analysis and reporting alone don't facilitate the assignment of the right resources to work an event in a timely fashion. A best practice for building a mature security operations team is to deeply integrate the flow of security events and findings into a notification and workflow system such as a ticketing system, a bug or issue system, or other security information and event management (SIEM) system. This takes the workflow out of email and static reports, and allows you to route, escalate, and manage events or findings. Many organizations are also integrating security alerts into their chat or collaboration, and developer productivity platforms. For organizations embarking on automation, an API-driven, low-latency ticketing system offers considerable flexibility when planning what to automate first. This best practice applies not only to security events generated from log messages depicting user activity or network events, but also from changes detected in the infrastructure itself. The ability to detect change, determine whether a change was appropriate, and then route that information to the correct remediation workflow is essential in maintaining and validating a secure architecture, in the context of changes where the nature of their undesirability is sufficiently subtle that their execution cannot currently be prevented with a combination of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and AWS Organizations configuration. Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Security Hub provide aggregation, deduplication, and analysis mechanisms for log records that are also made available to you via other AWS services. GuardDuty ingests, aggregates, and analyzes information from sources such as AWS CloudTrail management and data events, VPC DNS logs, and VPC Flow Logs. Security Hub can ingest, aggregate, and analyze output from GuardDuty, AWS Config, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macie, AWS Firewall Manager, and a significant number of third-party security products available in the AWS Marketplace, and if built accordingly, your own code. Both GuardDuty and Security Hub have an Administrator-Member model that can aggregate findings and insights across multiple accounts, and Security Hub is often used by customers who have an on- premises SIEM as an AWS-side log and alert preprocessor and aggregator from which they can then ingest Amazon EventBridge through a AWS Lambda-based processor and forwarder.",

The ability to detect change, determine whether a change was appropriate, and then route that information to the correct remediation workflow is essential in maintaining and validating a secure architecture, in the context of changes where the nature of their undesirability is sufficiently subtle that their execution cannot currently be prevented with a combination of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and AWS Organizations configuration. Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Security Hub provide aggregation, deduplication, and analysis mechanisms for log records that are also made available to you via other AWS services. GuardDuty ingests, aggregates, and analyzes information from sources such as AWS CloudTrail management and data events, VPC DNS logs, and VPC Flow Logs. Security Hub can ingest, aggregate, and analyze output from GuardDuty, AWS Config, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macie, AWS Firewall Manager, and a significant number of third-party security products available in the AWS Marketplace, and if built accordingly, your own code. Both GuardDuty and Security Hub have an Administrator-Member model that can aggregate findings and insights across multiple accounts, and Security Hub is often used by customers who have an on- premises SIEM as an AWS-side log and alert preprocessor and aggregator from which they can then ingest Amazon EventBridge through a AWS Lambda-based processor and forwarder.",

For example, if a component requires internet accessibility (inbound and outbound), connectivity to VPCs, edge services, and external data centers. A VPC allows you to define your network topology that spans an AWS Region with a private IPv4 address range that you set, or an IPv6 address range AWS selects. You should apply multiple controls with a defense in depth approach for both inbound and outbound traffic, including the use of security groups (stateful inspection firewall), Network ACLs, subnets, and route tables. Within a VPC, you can create subnets in an Availability Zone. Each subnet can have an associated route table that defines routing rules for managing the paths that traffic takes within the subnet. You can define an internet routable subnet by having a route that goes to an internet or NAT gateway attached to the VPC, or through another VPC. When an instance, Amazon Relational Database Service(Amazon RDS) database, or other service is launched within a VPC, it has its own security group per network interface. This firewall is outside the operating system layer and can be used to define rules for allowed inbound and outbound traffic. You can also define relationships between security groups. For example, instances within a database tier security group only accept traffic from instances within the application tier, by reference to the security groups applied to the instances involved. Unless you are using non-TCP protocols, it shouldn't be necessary to have an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) instance directly accessible by the internet (even with ports restricted by security groups) without a load balancer, or CloudFront. This helps protect it from unintended access through an operating system or application issue. A subnet can also have a network ACL attached to it, which acts as a stateless firewall. You should configure the network ACL to narrow the scope of traffic allowed between layers, note that you need to define both inbound and outbound rules. Some AWS services require components to access the internet for making API calls, where AWS API endpoints are located. Other AWS services use VPC endpoints within your Amazon VPCs.

Additionally, AWS CloudHSM is a cloud-based hardware security module (HSM) that enables you to easily generate and use your own encryption keys in the AWS Cloud. It helps you meet corporate, contractual, and regulatory compliance requirements for data security by using FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs.",
