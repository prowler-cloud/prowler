It provides a sample mapping to assist organizations in implementing security, operational, and governance checks using AWS Config. The conformance packs included serve as a guideline to help achieve compliance with CMMC Level 2 controls, although they do not guarantee full compliance. Users are responsible for assessing whether their use of AWS services meets the necessary legal and regulatory requirements.",

Changing the access keys on a regular schedule is a security best practice. It shortens the period an access key is active and reduces the business impact if the keys are compromised. This rule requires an access key rotation value (Config Default: 90). The actual value should reflect your organization's policies.",
