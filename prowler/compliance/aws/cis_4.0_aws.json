Contact details should not be for a single individual, as circumstances may arise where that individual is unavailable.

If this is unsuccessful and the account behavior needs urgent mitigation, proactive measures may be taken, including throttling of traffic between the account exhibiting suspicious behavior and the AWS API endpoints and the Internet. This will result in impaired service to and from the account in question, so it is in both the customers' and AWS's best interests that prompt contact can be established.

For example, you might choose the camera icon or choose an option similar to Scan code, and then use the device's camera to scan the code. - In the Manage MFA Device wizard, choose Show secret key for manual configuration, and then type the secret configuration key into your MFA application. When you are finished, the virtual MFA device starts generating one-time passwords.8. In the `Manage MFA Device wizard`, in the `MFA Code 1 box`, type the `one-time password` that currently appears in the virtual MFA device.

If any of the pending modifications require downtime, choosing this option can cause unexpected downtime for the application.8. Repeat steps 3-7 for each RDS instance in the current region.9. Change the AWS region from the navigation bar to repeat the process for other regions.**From Command Line:**1. Run the `describe-db-instances` command to list all available RDS database identifiers in the selected AWS region:```aws rds describe-db-instances --region <region-name> --query 'DBInstances[*].DBInstanceIdentifier'```2. The command output should return each database instance identifier.3. Run the `modify-db-instance` command to modify the configuration of a selected RDS instance, disabling the `Publicly Accessible` flag for that instance. This command uses the `apply-immediately` flag. If you want to avoid any downtime, the `--no-apply-immediately` flag can be used:```aws rds modify-db-instance --region <region-name> --db-instance-identifier <db-instance-name> --no-publicly-accessible --apply-immediately```4. The command output should reveal the `PubliclyAccessible` configuration under pending values, to be applied at the specified time.5. Updating the Internet Gateway destination via the AWS CLI is not currently supported. To update information about the Internet Gateway, please use the AWS Console procedure.6.

          "AuditProcedure": "**From Console:**1. Log in to the AWS management console and navigate to the RDS dashboard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.2. Under the navigation panel, on the RDS dashboard, click `Databases`.3. Select the RDS instance that you want to examine.4. Click `Instance Name` from the dashboard, under `Connectivity and Security`.5. In the `Security` section, check if the Publicly Accessible flag status is set to `Yes`.6. Follow the steps below to check database subnet access:- In the `networking` section, click the subnet link under `Subnets`.- The link will redirect you to the VPC Subnets page.- Select the subnet listed on the page and click the `Route Table` tab from the dashboard bottom panel.- If the route table contains any entries with the destination CIDR block set to `0.0.0.0/0` and an `Internet Gateway` attached, the selected RDS database instance was provisioned inside a public subnet; therefore, it is not running within a logically isolated environment and can be accessed from the Internet.7. Repeat steps 3-6 to determine the configuration of other RDS database instances provisioned in the current region.8. Change the AWS region from the navigation bar and repeat the audit process for other regions.**From Command Line:**1. Run the `describe-db-instances` command to list all available RDS database names in the selected AWS region:```aws rds describe-db-instances --region <region-name> --query 'DBInstances[*].DBInstanceIdentifier'```2. The command output should return each database instance `identifier`.3. Run the `describe-db-instances` command again, using the `PubliclyAccessible` parameter as a query filter to reveal the status of the database instance's Publicly Accessible flag:```aws rds describe-db-instances --region <region-name> --db-instance-identifier <db-instance-name> --query 'DBInstances[*].PubliclyAccessible'```4. Check the Publicly Accessible parameter status. If the Publicly Accessible flag is set to `Yes`, then the selected RDS database instance is publicly accessible and insecure. Follow the steps mentioned below to check database subnet access.5. Run the `describe-db-instances` command again using the RDS database instance identifier that you want to check, along with the appropriate filtering to describe the VPC subnet(s) associated with the selected instance:```aws rds describe-db-instances --region <region-name> --db-instance-identifier <db-instance-name> --query 'DBInstances[*].DBSubnetGroup.Subnets[]'```- The command output should list the subnets available in the selected database subnet group.6. Run the `describe-route-tables` command using the ID of the subnet returned in the previous step to describe the routes of the VPC route table associated with the selected subnet:```aws ec2 describe-route-tables --region <region-name> --filters Name=association.subnet-id,Values=<subnet-id> --query 'RouteTables[*].Routes[]'```- If the command returns the route table associated with the database instance subnet ID, check the values of the `GatewayId` and `DestinationCidrBlock` attributes returned in the output. If the route table contains any entries with the `GatewayId` value set to `igw-xxxxxxxx` and the `DestinationCidrBlock` value set to `0.0.0.0/0`, the selected RDS database instance was provisioned within a public subnet.- Or, if the command returns empty results, the route table is implicitly associated with the subnet; therefore, the audit process continues with the next step.7. Run the `describe-db-instances` command again using the RDS database instance identifier that you want to check, along with the appropriate filtering to describe the VPC ID associated with the selected instance:```aws rds describe-db-instances --region <region-name> --db-instance-identifier <db-instance-name> --query 'DBInstances[*].DBSubnetGroup.VpcId'```- The command output should show the VPC ID in the selected database subnet group.8. Now run the `describe-route-tables` command using the ID of the VPC returned in the previous step to describe the routes of the VPC's main route table that is implicitly associated with the selected subnet:```aws ec2 describe-route-tables --region <region-name> --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=<vpc-id> Name=association.main,Values=true --query 'RouteTables[*].Routes[]'```- The command output returns the VPC main route table implicitly associated with the database instance subnet ID. Check the values of the `GatewayId` and `DestinationCidrBlock` attributes returned in the output. If the route table contains any entries with the `GatewayId` value set to `igw-xxxxxxxx` and the `DestinationCidrBlock` value set to `0.0.0.0/0`, the selected RDS database instance was provisioned inside a public subnet; therefore, it is not running within a logically isolated environment and does not adhere to AWS security best practices.",

Repeat steps 2-5 to verify that each trail has multi-region enabled and is configured to log data events. If a trail does not have multi-region enabled and data event logging configured, refer to the remediation steps.**From Command Line:**1. Run the `describe-trails` command to list all trail names:```aws cloudtrail describe-trails --region <region-name> --output table --query trailList[*].Name```2. The command output will be table of the trail names.3. Run the `get-event-selectors` command using the name of a trail returned at the previous step and custom query filters to determine if data event logging is configured:```aws cloudtrail get-event-selectors --region <region-name> --trail-name <trail-name> --query EventSelectors[*].DataResources[]```4. The command output should be an array that includes the S3 bucket defined for data event logging.5. If the `get-event-selectors` command returns an empty array, data events are not included in the trail's logging configuration; therefore, object-level API operations performed on S3 buckets within your AWS account are not being recorded.6. Repeat steps 1-5 to verify the configuration of each trail.7. Change the AWS region by updating the `--region` command parameter, and perform the audit process for other regions.",

          "AdditionalInformation": "If an organization has an AWS Transit Gateway implemented in its VPC architecture, it should look to apply the recommendation above for a least access routing architecture at the AWS Transit Gateway level, in combination with what must be implemented at the standard VPC route table. More specifically, to route traffic between two or more VPCs via a Transit Gateway, VPCs must have an attachment to a Transit Gateway route table as well as a route. Therefore, to avoid routing traffic between VPCs, an attachment to the Transit Gateway route table should only be added where there is an intention to route traffic between the VPCs. As Transit Gateways are capable of hosting multiple route tables, it is possible to group VPCs by attaching them to a common route table.",
