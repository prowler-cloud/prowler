It includes 156 practices, building on the previous levels with additional requirements focused on detecting and responding to APTs. Level 4 practices emphasize the need for a more proactive approach to cybersecurity, including threat hunting and robust incident response mechanisms. AWS provides a range of tools and services that can help organizations achieve and maintain compliance with CMMC Level 4, ensuring enhanced security for sensitive information.",

This rule requires an access key rotation value (Config Default: 90). The actual value should reflect your organization's policies.",
