The auditor has to evaluate whether the documentation meets the referenced requirements of the ISO standard. This does not require a full certification audit of the management system in accordance with ISO 17021, but a focused inspection of the related documentation. Cross-sectional functions do not need to be integrated into a single ISMS. Instead, multiple ISMS can be established to cover both service-related internal control systems and central functions effectively. The scope of the ISMS may go beyond the scope of the cloud service provider's system of internal control for the cloud service in scope of an assurance engagement with this criteria catalogue. If the scope of the ISMS is broader than the scope of the assurance engagement, evidence to be obtained about the design and operation of the ISMS can be limited to records that are applicable to the cloud service in scope of the assurance engagement.",

OPS-05);- Logging and monitoring of events takes place along the container lifecycle and is executed according to a defined logging concept (cf.

OPS-29);- Access to the container host should take place in accordance with a roles and rights concept and a policy for managing access and access authorisations (cf. IAM-01, IAM-06);- Data stored on containers and data in transit should be encrypted as far as possible by the provider in accordance with the encryption policy (cf. CRY-01);- Measures to ensure network security are established. This includes, for example, measures to detect network anomalies (cf. COS-01 and COS-03) such as unexpected data flows within the network or unwanted access attempts;- Changes to containers and images follow a regulated process (cf.

They may also be performed as external audits, generally called second and third party audits. Second party audits are conducted by parties having an interest in the organisation, such as customers, or by other individuals on their behalf. Third party audits are conducted by independent auditing organisations. An audit programme comprises arrangements for a set of one or more audits planned for a specific time frame and directed towards a specific purpose. It may comprise internal and external audits. COM-02 is fully applicable to virtual infrastructure and infrastructure as code. Audit activities might still impact operations in a virtual environment. Reviews of configurations might for example be performed as part of code reviews.",
