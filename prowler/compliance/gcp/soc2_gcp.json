Improves Response and Recovery Procedures - Lessons learned are analyzed, and the incident response plan and recovery procedures are improved. Implements Incident Recovery Plan Testing - Incident recovery plan testing is performed on a periodic basis. The testing includes (1) development of testing scenarios based on threat likelihood and magnitude; (2) consideration of relevant system components from across the entity that can impair availability; (3) scenarios that consider the potential for the lack of availability of key personnel; and (4) revision of continuity plans and systems based on test results.",
