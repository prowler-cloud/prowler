          "Description": "To apply least-privilege security principle, one can create service-level administrators in corresponding groups and assigning specific users to each service-level administrative group in a tenancy. This limits administrative access in a tenancy. \n\nIt means service-level administrators can only manage resources of a specific service.\n\nExample policies for global/tenant level service-administrators\n```\nAllow group VolumeAdmins to manage volume-family in tenancy\nAllow group ComputeAdmins to manage instance-family in tenancy\nAllow group NetworkAdmins to manage virtual-network-family in tenancy\n```\n\n```\nA tenancy with identity domains : An Identity Domain is a container of users, groups, Apps and other security configurations. A tenancy that has Identity Domains available comes seeded with a 'Default' identity domain. \n\nIf a group belongs to a domain different than the default domain, use a domain prefix in the policy statements.\nExample - \nAllow group <identity_domain_name>/<group_name> to <verb> <resource-type> in compartment <compartment_name>\n\nIf you do not include the <identity_domain_name> before the <group_name>, then the policy statement is evaluated as though the group belongs to the default identity domain.\n\n```\nOrganizations have various ways of defining service-administrators. Some may prefer creating service administrators at a tenant level and some per department or per project or even per application environment ( dev/test/production etc.). Either approach works so long as the policies are written to limit access given to the service-administrators.\n\n Example policies for compartment level service-administrators \n\n```\nAllow group NonProdComputeAdmins to manage instance-family in compartment dev\nAllow group ProdComputeAdmins to manage instance-family in compartment production\nAllow group A-Admins to manage instance-family in compartment Project-A\nAllow group A-Admins to manage volume-family in compartment Project-A\n```\n\n```\nA tenancy with identity domains : An Identity Domain is a container of users, groups, Apps and other security configurations.

          "Description": "Password policies are used to enforce password complexity requirements. IAM password policies can be used to ensure passwords are at least a certain length and are composed of certain characters. \n\nIt is recommended the password policy require a minimum password length 14 characters and contain 1 non-alphabetic\ncharacter (Number or “Special Character”).",
          "RationaleStatement": "In keeping with the overall goal of having users create a password that is not overly weak, an eight-character minimum password length is recommended for an MFA account, and 14 characters for a password only account. In addition, maximum password length should be made as long as possible based on system/software capabilities and not restricted by policy.\n\nIn general, it is true that longer passwords are better (harder to crack), but it is also true that forced password length requirements can cause user behavior that is predictable and undesirable. For example, requiring users to have a minimum 16-character password may cause them to choose repeating patterns like fourfourfourfour or passwordpassword that meet the requirement but aren’t hard to guess. Additionally, length requirements increase the chances that users will adopt other insecure practices, like writing them down, re-using them or storing them unencrypted in their documents. \n\nPassword composition requirements are a poor defense against guessing attacks. Forcing users to choose some combination of upper-case, lower-case, numbers, and special characters has a negative impact. It places an extra burden on users and many\nwill use predictable patterns (for example, a capital letter in the first position, followed by lowercase letters, then one or two numbers, and a “special character” at the end). Attackers know this, so dictionary attacks will often contain these common patterns and use the most common substitutions like, $ for s, @ for a, 1 for l, 0 for o.\n\nPasswords that are too complex in nature make it harder for users to remember, leading to bad practices. In addition, composition requirements provide no defense against common attack types such as social engineering or insecure storage of passwords.",

Also, password expiration requirements offer no containment benefits because attackers will often use credentials as soon as they compromise them. Instead, immediate password changes should be based on key events including, but not\nlimited to:\n\n1. Indication of compromise\n1. Change of user roles\n1. When a user leaves the organization.\n\nNot only does changing passwords every few weeks or months frustrate the user, it’s been suggested that it does more harm than good, because it could lead to bad practices by the user such as adding a character to the end of their existing password.\n\nIn addition, we also recommend a yearly password change. This is primarily because for all their good intentions users will share credentials across accounts. Therefore, even if a breach is publicly identified, the user may not see this notification, or forget they have an account on that site. This could leave a shared credential vulnerable indefinitely. Having an organizational policy of a 1-year (annual) password expiration is a reasonable compromise to mitigate this with minimal user burden.",

          "Description": "When you create a cloud resource such as an instance, block volume, or cloud network, you must specify to which compartment you want the resource to belong. Placing resources in the root compartment makes it difficult to organize and isolate those resources.",
          "RationaleStatement": "Placing resources into a compartment will allow you to organize and have more granular access controls to your cloud resources.",
          "ImpactStatement": "Placing a resource in a compartment will impact how you write policies to manage access and organize that resource.",
          "RemediationProcedure": "**From Console:**\n1. Follow audit procedure above.\n2. For each item in the returned results, click the item name.\n3. Then select `Move Resource` or `More Actions` then `Move Resource`.\n4. Select a compartment that is not the root compartment in `CHOOSE NEW COMPARTMENT`.\n5. Click `Move Resource`.\n\n**From CLI:**\n1. Follow the audit procedure above.\n2. For each bucket item execute the below command: \n```\noci os bucket update --bucket-name <bucket-name> --compartment-id <not root compartment-id>\n```\n3. For other resources use the `change-compartment` command for the resource type:\n``` \noci <service-command> <resource-command> change-compartment --<item-id> <item-id> --compartment-id <not root compartment-id>\n```\n\n i. Example for an Autonomous Database:\n\n```\noci db autonomous-database change-compartment --autonomous-database-id <autonmous-database-id> --compartment-id <not root compartment-id>\n```",
          "AuditProcedure": "**From Console:**\n1. Login into the OCI Console.\n2. Click in the search bar, top of the screen.\n3. Type `Advance Resource Query` and hit `enter`.\n4. Click the `Advanced Resource Query` button in the upper right of the screen.\n5. Enter the following query into the query box:\n```\nquery\n VCN, instance, bootvolume, volume, filesystem, bucket, \nautonomousdatabase, database, dbsystem resources\n where compartmentId = '<tenancy-id>'\n```\n6. Ensure query returns no results.\n\n**From CLI:**\n1. Execute the following command:\n```\noci search resource structured-search --query-text \"query\n VCN, instance, volume, bootvolume, filesystem, bucket, \nautonomousdatabase, database, dbsystem resources\n where compartmentId = '<tenancy-id>'\"\n```\n2. Ensure query return no results.",
