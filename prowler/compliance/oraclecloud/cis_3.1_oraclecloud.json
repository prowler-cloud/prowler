          "Description": "To apply least-privilege security principle, one can create service-level administrators in corresponding groups and assigning specific users to each service-level administrative group in a tenancy. This limits administrative access in a tenancy. It means service-level administrators can only manage resources of a specific service.Example policies for global/tenant level service-administrators```Allow group VolumeAdmins to manage volume-family in tenancyAllow group ComputeAdmins to manage instance-family in tenancyAllow group NetworkAdmins to manage virtual-network-family in tenancy``````A tenancy with identity domains : An Identity Domain is a container of users, groups, Apps and other security configurations. A tenancy that has Identity Domains available comes seeded with a 'Default' identity domain. If a group belongs to a domain different than the default domain, use a domain prefix in the policy statements.Example - Allow group <identity_domain_name>/<group_name> to <verb> <resource-type> in compartment <compartment_name>If you do not include the <identity_domain_name> before the <group_name>, then the policy statement is evaluated as though the group belongs to the default identity domain.```Organizations have various ways of defining service-administrators. Some may prefer creating service administrators at a tenant level and some per department or per project or even per application environment ( dev/test/production etc.). Either approach works so long as the policies are written to limit access given to the service-administrators. Example policies for compartment level service-administrators ```Allow group NonProdComputeAdmins to manage instance-family in compartment devAllow group ProdComputeAdmins to manage instance-family in compartment productionAllow group A-Admins to manage instance-family in compartment Project-AAllow group A-Admins to manage volume-family in compartment Project-A``````A tenancy with identity domains : An Identity Domain is a container of users, groups, Apps and other security configurations.

          "Description": "Password policies are used to enforce password complexity requirements. IAM password policies can be used to ensure passwords are at least a certain length and are composed of certain characters. It is recommended the password policy require a minimum password length 14 characters and contain 1 non-alphabeticcharacter (Number or “Special Character”).",
          "RationaleStatement": "In keeping with the overall goal of having users create a password that is not overly weak, an eight-character minimum password length is recommended for an MFA account, and 14 characters for a password only account. In addition, maximum password length should be made as long as possible based on system/software capabilities and not restricted by policy.In general, it is true that longer passwords are better (harder to crack), but it is also true that forced password length requirements can cause user behavior that is predictable and undesirable. For example, requiring users to have a minimum 16-character password may cause them to choose repeating patterns like fourfourfourfour or passwordpassword that meet the requirement but aren’t hard to guess. Additionally, length requirements increase the chances that users will adopt other insecure practices, like writing them down, re-using them or storing them unencrypted in their documents. Password composition requirements are a poor defense against guessing attacks. Forcing users to choose some combination of upper-case, lower-case, numbers, and special characters has a negative impact. It places an extra burden on users and manywill use predictable patterns (for example, a capital letter in the first position, followed by lowercase letters, then one or two numbers, and a “special character” at the end). Attackers know this, so dictionary attacks will often contain these common patterns and use the most common substitutions like, $ for s, @ for a, 1 for l, 0 for o.Passwords that are too complex in nature make it harder for users to remember, leading to bad practices. In addition, composition requirements provide no defense against common attack types such as social engineering or insecure storage of passwords.",

In these cases, the next password can be predicted based on the previous one (incrementing a number used in the password for example). Also, password expiration requirements offer no containment benefits because attackers will often use credentials as soon as they compromise them. Instead, immediate password changes should be based on key events including, but notlimited to:1. Indication of compromise1. Change of user roles1. When a user leaves the organization.Not only does changing passwords every few weeks or months frustrate the user, it's been suggested that it does more harm than good, because it could lead to bad practices by the user such as adding a character to the end of their existing password.In addition, we also recommend a yearly password change. This is primarily because for all their good intentions users will share credentials across accounts. Therefore, even if a breach is publicly identified, the user may not see this notification, or forget they have an account on that site. This could leave a shared credential vulnerable indefinitely. Having an organizational policy of a 1-year (annual) password expiration is a reasonable compromise to mitigate this with minimal user burden.",
