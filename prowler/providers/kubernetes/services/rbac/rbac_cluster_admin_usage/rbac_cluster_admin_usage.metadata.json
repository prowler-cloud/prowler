  "Description": "This check ensures that the 'cluster-admin' role, which provides wide-ranging powers, is used only where necessary. The 'cluster-admin' role grants super-user access to perform any action on any resource, including all namespaces. It should be applied cautiously to avoid excessive privileges.",
  "Risk": "Inappropriate use of the 'cluster-admin' role can lead to excessive privileges, increasing the risk of malicious actions and potentially impacting the cluster's security posture.",
