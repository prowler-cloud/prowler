  "Description": "This check ensures that access to the proxy sub-resource of node objects is restricted. Access to this sub-resource can grant privileges to use the Kubelet API directly, bypassing Kubernetes API controls like audit logging and admission control, potentially leading to privilege escalation.",
  "Risk": "Unauthorized access to the proxy sub-resource of node objects can lead to significant security vulnerabilities, including privilege escalation.",
