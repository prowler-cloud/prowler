  "Description": "Disable profiling in the Kubernetes Scheduler unless it is needed for troubleshooting. Profiling can reveal detailed system and application performance data, which might be exploited if exposed. Turning off profiling reduces the potential attack surface and performance overhead.",
  "Risk": "While profiling is useful for identifying performance issues, it generates detailed data that could potentially expose sensitive information about the system and its performance characteristics.",
