  "Description": "**Etcd pods** are assessed for **TLS-enabled client communication**, indicated by `--cert-file` and `--key-file` in container arguments, showing that Kubernetes API state traffic is encrypted in transit.",
  "Risk": "Without **TLS**, etcd traffic is exposed on the network, weakening CIA:\n- Confidentiality: leakage of **secrets** and cluster state\n- Integrity: **MITM** can alter configs, roles, and objects\n- Availability: control-plane instability from tampered responses",

      "Text": "Enforce **mTLS** for etcd client and peer traffic and disable plaintext listeners. Restrict access to etcd to control-plane components via tight network policies and firewalls. Use strong TLS versions/ciphers, rotate certificates, and safeguard keys, applying **least privilege** and **defense in depth**.",
