  "Description": "This check verifies that the etcd service in a Kubernetes cluster is configured with appropriate TLS encryption settings. etcd, being a key value store for all Kubernetes REST API objects, should have its communication encrypted to protect these sensitive objects in transit.",
  "Risk": "Without proper TLS configuration, data stored in etcd can be susceptible to interception and unauthorized access, posing a significant security risk to the entire Kubernetes cluster.",
