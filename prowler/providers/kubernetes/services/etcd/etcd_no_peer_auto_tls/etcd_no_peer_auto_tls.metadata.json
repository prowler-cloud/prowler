  "ResourceType": "Pod",
  "ResourceGroup": "container",
  "Description": "**Etcd peer TLS** configuration is evaluated by checking etcd containers for the `--peer-auto-tls` flag. Presence of `--peer-auto-tls` indicates peers use automatically generated self-signed certificates for inter-peer connections.",
  "Risk": "With `--peer-auto-tls`, traffic is encrypted but peer identity isn't verified, enabling:\n- MITM on peer links\n- Rogue member joins to read/modify data\n- Quorum disruption\n\nThis degrades **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability** of control-plane state replicated in etcd.",

    "Recommendation": {
      "Text": "Disable `--peer-auto-tls` and use **mTLS** with a trusted CA issuing unique per-member peer certificates. Enforce SAN validation and, *where supported*, peer certificate authentication. Apply **least privilege**, separate CAs for peers/clients, rotate keys, and monitor certificate expiry and peer membership.",
