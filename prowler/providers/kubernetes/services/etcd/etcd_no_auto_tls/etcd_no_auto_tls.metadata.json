  "Description": "**etcd** configuration is reviewed for the `--auto-tls` option, which enables automatically generated self-signed certificates for client TLS.\n\nPresence of this flag indicates self-signed TLS is used; absence indicates client TLS relies on externally managed certificates.",
  "Risk": "Using **self-signed auto TLS** weakens identity assurance, enabling spoofed endpoints and **man-in-the-middle** on etcd client traffic. Attackers could read or alter Kubernetes state in etcd, impacting **confidentiality** and **integrity**, and facilitating control-plane takeover or data exfiltration.",

In containers -> command or args, remove any occurrence of --auto-tls or --auto-tls=true (do not set it to false)\n4. Save and exit; kubelet will recreate the etcd pod automatically\n5.

    "Recommendation": {
      "Text": "Disable `--auto-tls` and use **CA-signed certificates** with **mutual TLS** for etcd clients. Apply managed PKI to enforce trusted CAs, rotate and revoke keys, and prefer modern TLS versions and strong cipher suites. Monitor certificate expiry and limit access per **least privilege** for **defense in depth**.",
