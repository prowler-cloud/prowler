  "Description": "This check ensures that the NodeRestriction admission control plugin is enabled in the Kubernetes API server. NodeRestriction limits the Node and Pod objects that a kubelet can modify, enhancing security by ensuring kubelets are restricted to manage their own node and pods.",
  "Risk": "Without NodeRestriction, kubelets may have broader access to Node and Pod objects, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications and security risks.",
