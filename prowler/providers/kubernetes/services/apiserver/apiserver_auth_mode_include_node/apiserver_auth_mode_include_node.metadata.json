  "Description": "This check ensures that the Kubernetes API server is configured to include 'Node' in its --authorization-mode argument. This mode restricts kubelets to only read objects associated with their nodes, enhancing security.",
  "Risk": "If the Node authorization mode is not included, kubelets may have broader access than necessary, which can pose a security risk.",
