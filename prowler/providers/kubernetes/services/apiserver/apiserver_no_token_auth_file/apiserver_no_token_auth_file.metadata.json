  "Description": "This check ensures that the Kubernetes API server is not using static token-based authentication, which is less secure. Static tokens are stored in clear-text and lack features like revocation or rotation without restarting the API server.",
  "Risk": "Using static token-based authentication exposes the cluster to security risks due to the static nature of the tokens, their clear-text storage, and the inability to revoke or rotate them easily.",
