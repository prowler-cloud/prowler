  "Description": "This check verifies that Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is enabled in the Kubernetes API server's authorization mode. RBAC allows for fine-grained control over cluster operations and is recommended for secure and manageable access control.",
  "Risk": "If RBAC is not included in the API server's authorization mode, the cluster may not be leveraging fine-grained access controls, leading to potential security risks.",
