  "Description": "**Kubelet** configuration file `config.yaml` (e.g., `/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml`) is evaluated to confirm ownership by `root:root` when the kubelet uses a config file via `--config`.",
  "Risk": "**Non-root ownership** of kubelet `config.yaml` enables local users or daemons to alter node-agent settings, affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability. They could weaken authN/Z, enable insecure ports, or redirect certificate paths, leading to node takeover, lateral movement, data exfiltration, and workload disruption.",
