  "Description": "Google Workspace domain has between **2 and 4 super administrators**.\n\nHaving too few super admins creates a **single point of failure** and administrative access issues if the only admin is unavailable. Having too many super admins increases the **attack surface** and the risk of unauthorized access to critical administrative functions.",
  "Risk": "Having fewer than 2 super administrators creates a **single point of failure** and may prevent administrative access in emergencies.\n\nHaving more than 4 super administrators increases the security risk by expanding the **attack surface** for compromised accounts with full **administrative privileges**.",
