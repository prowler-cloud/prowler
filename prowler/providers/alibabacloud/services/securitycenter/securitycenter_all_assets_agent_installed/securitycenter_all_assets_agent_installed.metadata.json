  "Description": "The endpoint protection of **Security Center** requires an agent to be installed on the endpoint to work. Such an agent-based approach allows the security center to provide comprehensive endpoint intrusion detection and protection capabilities.\n\nThis includes remote logon detection, **webshell detection** and removal, **anomaly detection** (detection of abnormal process behaviors and network connections), and detection of changes in key files and suspicious accounts.",
  "Risk": "Assets without **Security Center agent** installed are not protected by endpoint intrusion detection and protection capabilities, leaving them vulnerable to security threats.\n\nUnprotected assets become blind spots in your security monitoring.",
