  "Description": "The endpoint protection of Security requires an agent to be installed on the endpoint to work. Such an agent-based approach allows the security center to provide a set of more comprehensive endpoint intrusion detection and protection capabilities, such as includes remote logon detection, webshell detection and removal, anomaly detection (detection of abnormal process behaviors and abnormal network connections), and detection of changes in key files and suspicious accounts in systems and applications.",
  "Risk": "Assets without Security Center agent installed are not protected by endpoint intrusion detection and protection capabilities, leaving them vulnerable to security threats.",
