  "Description": "Database Server should accept connections only from trusted Network(s)/IP(s) and restrict access from the world. To minimize attack surface on a Database server Instance, only trusted/known and required IP(s) should be white-listed to connect to it. Authorized network should not have IPs/networks configured to 0.0.0.0 or /0 which will allow access to the instance from anywhere in the world.",
  "Risk": "Allowing public access (0.0.0.0/0) to the database significantly increases the risk of brute-force attacks, unauthorized access, and data exfiltration.",
