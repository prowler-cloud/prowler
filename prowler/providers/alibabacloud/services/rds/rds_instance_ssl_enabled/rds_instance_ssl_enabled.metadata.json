  "Description": "It is recommended to enforce all incoming connections to SQL database instance to use SSL. SQL database connections if successfully trapped (MITM); can reveal sensitive data like credentials, database queries, query outputs etc. For security, it is recommended to always use SSL encryption when connecting to your instance.",
  "Risk": "If SSL is not enabled, data in transit (including credentials and query results) can be intercepted by attackers performing Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.",
