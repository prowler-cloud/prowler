  "Description": "**TDE with BYOK** support provides increased transparency and control, increased security with an HSM-backed KMS service, and promotion of separation of duties.\n\nBased on business needs or criticality of data, it is recommended that the TDE protector is encrypted by a key that is managed by the data owner (**BYOK**).",
  "Risk": "Using **service-managed keys** means the cloud provider manages the encryption keys. **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** gives you full control over the key lifecycle and permissions.\n\nThis ensures that even the cloud provider cannot access your data without your explicit permission.",
