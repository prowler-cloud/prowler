  "Description": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection on top of a username and password. With MFA enabled, when a user logs on to Alibaba Cloud, they will be prompted for their user name and password followed by an authentication code from their virtual MFA device. It is recommended that MFA be enabled for all users that have a console password.",
  "Risk": "MFA requires users to verify their identities by entering two authentication factors. When MFA is enabled, an attacker faces at least two different authentication mechanisms. The additional security makes it harder for an attacker to gain access to protected resources or data.",
