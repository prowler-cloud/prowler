  "Description": "By default, RAM users, groups, and roles have no access to Alibaba Cloud resources. RAM policies are the means by which privileges are granted to users, groups, or roles. It is recommended that RAM policies be applied directly to groups and roles but not users.",
  "Risk": "Assigning privileges at the group or role level reduces the complexity of access management as the number of users grows. Reducing access management complexity may in turn reduce opportunity for a principal to inadvertently receive or retain excessive privileges.",
