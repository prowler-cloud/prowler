  "Description": "RAM policies represent permissions that can be granted to users, groups, or roles. It is recommended and considered a standard security advice to grant least privilege—that is, granting only the permissions required to perform tasks. Determine what users need to do and then create policies with permissions only fits those tasks, instead of allowing full administrative privileges.",
  "Risk": "It is more secure to start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary, rather than starting with permissions that exceed the necessity and then trying to tighten them later. Providing full administrative privileges exposes your resources on Alibaba Cloud to potentially unwanted actions. RAM policies that have a statement with \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"*\", and \"Resource\": \"*\" should be prohibited.",
