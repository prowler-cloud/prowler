  "Description": "A network policy is a specification of how groups of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. NetworkPolicy resources use labels to select pods and define rules which specify what traffic is allowed to the selected pods. By default, pods are non-isolated; they accept traffic from any source. Pods become isolated by having a NetworkPolicy that selects them.",
  "Risk": "Without Network Policies, all pods in a Kubernetes cluster can communicate with each other freely. This open communication model allows an attacker who compromises a single pod to potentially move laterally within the cluster and access sensitive services or data.",
