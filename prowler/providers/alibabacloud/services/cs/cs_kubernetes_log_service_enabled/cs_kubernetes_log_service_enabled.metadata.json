  "Description": "**Log Service** is a complete real-time data logging service on Alibaba Cloud supporting collection, shipping, search, storage, and analysis for logs.\n\nLog Service can automatically collect, process, and store your container and audit logs in a dedicated, persistent datastore. Container logs are collected from your containers, audit logs from the `kube-apiserver` or deployed ingress, and events about cluster activity such as the deletion of Pods or Secrets.",
  "Risk": "Without **Log Service** enabled, you lose visibility into container and system logs. The per-node logging agent collects: `kube-apiserver` audit logs, ingress visiting logs, and standard output/error logs from containerized processes.\n\nLack of logging makes **incident investigation**, **compliance auditing**, and **security monitoring** significantly more difficult.",
