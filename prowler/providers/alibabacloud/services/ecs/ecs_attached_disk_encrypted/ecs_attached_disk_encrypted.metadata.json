  "Description": "ECS cloud disk encryption protects your data at rest. The cloud disk data encryption feature automatically encrypts data when data is transferred from ECS instances to disks, and decrypts data when the data is read from disks. Ensure that disks are encrypted when they are created with the creation of VM instance.",
  "Risk": "Unencrypted disks attached to ECS instances pose a security risk as they may contain sensitive data that could be accessed if the disk is compromised or accessed by unauthorized parties.",
