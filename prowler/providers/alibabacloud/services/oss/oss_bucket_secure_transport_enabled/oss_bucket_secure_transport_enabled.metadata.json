  "Description": "Enable the data encryption in transit. The secure transfer enhances the security of OSS bucket by only allowing requests to the storage account by a secure connection. For example, when calling REST APIs to access storage accounts, the connection must use HTTPS. Any requests using HTTP will be rejected.",
  "Risk": "Without secure transfer enforcement, OSS buckets may accept HTTP requests, which are not encrypted in transit. This exposes data to potential interception and man-in-the-middle attacks.",
