  "Description": "OSS Bucket Access Logging generates a log that contains access records for each request made to your OSS bucket. An access log record contains details about the request, such as the request type, the resources specified in the request worked, and the time and date the request was processed. It is recommended that bucket access logging be enabled on the OSS bucket.",
  "Risk": "By enabling OSS bucket logging on target OSS buckets, it is possible to capture all events which may affect objects within an target buckets. Configuring logs to be placed in a separate bucket allows access to log information which can be useful in security and incident response workflows.",
