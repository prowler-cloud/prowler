  "Description": "**OCI IAM user database passwords** are evaluated for **age**. Passwords are compared to a rotation window of `90 days`, flagging credentials that have not been refreshed within that period for the associated user accounts and regions.\n\n*Covers each user's active database passwords tracked by IAM.*",
  "Risk": "Stale **database credentials** increase exposure to **brute-force**, **credential stuffing**, and reuse of leaked passwords. If compromised, attackers can gain direct DB access, enabling **data exfiltration** (C), unauthorized changes to schemas or data (I), and service disruption via destructive queries (A). Long-lived secrets can bypass offboarding.",
