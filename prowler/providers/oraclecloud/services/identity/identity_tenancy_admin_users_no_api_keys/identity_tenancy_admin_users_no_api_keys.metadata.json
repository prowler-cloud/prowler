  "Description": "OCI tenancy administrator accounts (members of the `Administrators` group) are inspected for configured user **API keys** tied to those identities.",
  "Risk": "**Admin API keys** are long-lived secrets that can be stolen from endpoints or repos, enabling non-interactive, MFA-less access. Attackers could run privileged API calls, exfiltrate data, modify policies, or delete resources, impacting **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability**.",

Require **SSO/MFA** for admin access, and enforce rapid key revocation and rotation for any programmatic identities.",
