  "Severity": "medium",
  "ResourceType": "Bucket",
  "Description": "**Object Storage buckets** use **customer-managed encryption keys** (`CMEK`) for server-side encryption, with an associated KMS key configured on the bucket.",
  "Risk": "Without `CMEK`, encryption relies on provider-managed keys, reducing control over **confidentiality** and key lifecycle. You cannot strictly limit key usage, enforce custom rotation, or revoke keys for crypto-erasure, increasing exposure to unauthorized decryption, data exfiltration, and auditability gaps.",

      "Other": "1. Sign in to the OCI Console\n2. Go to Storage > Object Storage & Archive Storage > Buckets\n3. Open the target bucket\n4. Click Edit bucket\n5. Under Encryption, select Customer-managed key and choose the desired Vault key\n6. Click Save",
      "Terraform": "```hcl\nresource \"oci_objectstorage_bucket\" \"<example_resource_name>\" {\n  compartment_id = \"<example_resource_id>\"\n  name           = \"<example_resource_name>\"\n  namespace      = \"<example_resource_name>\"\n\n  kms_key_id = \"<example_resource_id>\" # Critical: sets the Customer Managed Key to encrypt the bucket\n}\n```"
    },
    "Recommendation": {
      "Text": "Encrypt buckets with `CMEK`. Apply **least privilege** to key usage, enforce **separation of duties** between key and storage admins, mandate regular rotation, and monitor key access. Use **defense in depth** so encryption complements strict IAM and network controls rather than replacing them.",
