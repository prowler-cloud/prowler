  "Description": "**OCI compute instances** have **UEFI Secure Boot** enabled so the platform firmware loads only trusted, signed bootloaders, kernels, and drivers at startup.",
  "Risk": "Without **Secure Boot**, unsigned or tampered boot code can run before the OS, enabling **bootkits/rootkits** to gain kernel-level persistence, bypass monitoring, alter logs, and exfiltrate secrets, eroding **integrity** and **confidentiality**, and risking **availability** through destructive changes or ransom staging.",

      "Text": "Enable **Secure Boot** across instances and prefer **shielded instances**. Pair with **TPM** and **Measured Boot** where supported for defense in depth. Permit only trusted, signed kernels and drivers, and manage updates via hardened golden images and code signing. *On Windows VMs, use Secure Boot with TPM and Measured Boot.*",
