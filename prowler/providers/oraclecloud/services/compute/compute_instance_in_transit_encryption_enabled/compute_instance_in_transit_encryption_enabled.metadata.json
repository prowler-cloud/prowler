  "Description": "**OCI compute instances** are evaluated for **in-transit encryption** on paravirtualized block or boot volume attachments, confirming that data exchanged between the instance and attached volumes is encrypted during transfer.",
  "Risk": "Without **in-transit encryption**, volume traffic can be inspected or altered on internal paths. A threat actor or compromised host could read sensitive data, inject corrupted blocks, or replay writes, undermining **confidentiality** and **integrity**, and risking **availability** through data corruption.",
