  "Description": "**AWS Organizations delegated administrators** are compared against a predefined **trusted list** to identify delegations that are not explicitly approved. The evaluation also notes when no delegated administrators exist.",
  "Risk": "Unapproved delegated administrators can alter **SCPs**, invite/move accounts, and create privileged roles, enabling **privilege escalation**. This undermines guardrails, risking loss of **integrity**, exposure of **confidentiality** across accounts, and impacts **availability** through organization-wide policy changes.",
