  "Description": "Elastic Load Balancers are evaluated for the `scheme` to determine whether they are **internet-facing** or internal, indicating if the endpoint is publicly reachable via a public DNS name.",
  "Risk": "An unintended **internet-facing** load balancer exposes backends to the Internet, enabling reconnaissance, credential stuffing, and exploitation of app flaws. This can lead to data exposure (confidentiality), unauthorized changes (integrity), and **DDoS** or resource exhaustion (availability).",

      "Text": "Use `internal` load balancers for private services and restrict exposure with **security groups**, subnets, and allowlists. For public endpoints, apply **defense in depth**: associate an **AWS WAF** web ACL (*when supported*), enforce **TLS**, least-privilege network rules, and consider **Shield** or rate limiting. Regularly review necessity of public access.",
