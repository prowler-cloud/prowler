  "Description": "**Classic Load Balancer** has **connection draining** enabled, so deregistering or unhealthy instances stop receiving new requests while existing connections are allowed to complete within the configured drain window.",
  "Risk": "Without **connection draining**, instance removals or health failures can terminate in-flight requests, leading to partial transactions, broken sessions, and inconsistent application state. This reduces **availability** and can impact **data integrity** during deployments, scaling, or failover events.",

      "Text": "Enable **connection draining** on all Classic Load Balancers and set a drain interval aligned to typical request latency. Coordinate autoscaling and deployments to allow graceful instance shutdowns. Monitor errors and retries to validate behavior and adjust the `timeout` conservatively to protect **availability** and **integrity**.",
