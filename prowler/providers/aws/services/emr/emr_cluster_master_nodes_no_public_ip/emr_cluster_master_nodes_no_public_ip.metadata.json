  "Description": "**Amazon EMR clusters** in non-terminated states are assessed for **public IP assignment** on cluster nodes (primary and workers). The finding identifies clusters whose instances are reachable via public IPs rather than private VPC addresses.",
  "Risk": "**Publicly reachable EMR nodes** expose admin UIs and SSH to the Internet, enabling brute force and service exploits. A compromised primary node can alter jobs and exfiltrate data from S3/HDFS, degrading **confidentiality** and **integrity**, and disrupt workloads, impacting **availability**.",

Keep **EMR block public access** enabled and favor **private connectivity** for external dependencies.",
