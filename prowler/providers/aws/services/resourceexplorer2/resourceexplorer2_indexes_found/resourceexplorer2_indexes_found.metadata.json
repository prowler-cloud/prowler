  "Description": "**AWS Resource Explorer** has user-owned **indexes** present in the account. The assessment determines whether at least one index exists in any enabled Region for resource cataloging and search.",
  "Risk": "Absent indexes reduce asset visibility, creating blind spots where misconfigured or orphaned resources go unnoticed. This degrades **confidentiality** (unseen public exposure), **integrity** (unauthorized changes undetected), and **availability** (slower containment and recovery), prolonging incident response and enabling lateral movement.",

      "Other": "1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open **AWS Resource Explorer**\n2. Go to **Settings** > **Indexes**\n3. Click **Create indexes**\n4. Select the current Region and click **Create indexes**\n5. Wait until the index state is ACTIVE",

    "Recommendation": {
      "Text": "Create **Resource Explorer indexes** in all active Regions and designate an **aggregator index** for cross-Region search. Apply least-privilege access to views, align with tagging standards, and routinely verify indexing status. This improves inventory accuracy, supports defense-in-depth, and speeds detection and remediation.",
