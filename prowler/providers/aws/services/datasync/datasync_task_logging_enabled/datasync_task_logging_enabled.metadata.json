  "Description": "**AWS DataSync tasks** are evaluated for a configured **CloudWatch Logs** destination (`CloudWatchLogGroupArn`).\n\nTasks that specify a log group are recognized as logging-enabled; those without one are identified as not publishing execution events.",
  "Risk": "**Absent DataSync task logs** create blind spots, preventing timely detection of **failed or partial transfers**, unexpected deletions, or anomalies. This undermines data **integrity** verification, obscures potential **exfiltration** indicators, and slows forensics and recovery, reducing **availability** during incidents.",
