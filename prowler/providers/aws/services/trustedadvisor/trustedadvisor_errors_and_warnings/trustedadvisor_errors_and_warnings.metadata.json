  "Description": "**AWS Trusted Advisor** check statuses are assessed to identify items in `warning` or `error`. The finding reflects the state reported by Trusted Advisor across categories such as **Security**, **Fault Tolerance**, **Service Limits**, and **Cost**, indicating where configurations or quotas require attention.",
  "Risk": "Unaddressed **warnings/errors** can leave misconfigurations that impact CIA:\n- **Confidentiality**: public access or weak auth exposes data\n- **Integrity**: overly permissive settings allow unwanted changes\n- **Availability**: limit exhaustion or poor resilience triggers outages\nThey can also increase unnecessary cost.",
