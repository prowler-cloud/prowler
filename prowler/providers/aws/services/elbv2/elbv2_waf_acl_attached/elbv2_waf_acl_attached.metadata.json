  "Description": "Application Load Balancers are evaluated for an associated **AWS WAF web ACL** that governs HTTP(S) requests. The evaluation detects ALBs missing a web ACL and recognizes associations from **WAFv2** or regional **WAF Classic**.",
  "Risk": "Absent a **WAF web ACL**, ALBs accept unfiltered Layer 7 traffic, enabling:\n- **Injection** (SQLi/XSS) harming confidentiality and integrity\n- **Credential stuffing** and **bot abuse**\n- **Resource exhaustion** degrading availability",
