Cross-zone load balancing ensures even distribution of traffic across all registered targets in all Availability Zones, improving fault tolerance and load distribution.",
  "Risk": "If cross-zone load balancing is not enabled, traffic may not be evenly distributed across Availability Zones, leading to over-utilization of resources in certain zones and potential application performance degradation or outages.",
