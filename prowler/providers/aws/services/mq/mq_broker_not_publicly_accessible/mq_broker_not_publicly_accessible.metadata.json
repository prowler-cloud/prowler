  "Description": "Brokers created without public accessibility can't be accessed from outside of your VPC. This greatly reduces your broker's susceptibility to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks from the public internet.",
  "Risk": "Public Amazon MQ brokers can be accessed directly, outside of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), therefore every machine on the Internet can reach your brokers through their public endpoints and this can increase the opportunity for malicious activity such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking attacks.
