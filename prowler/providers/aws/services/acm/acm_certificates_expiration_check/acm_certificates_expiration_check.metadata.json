  "Description": "**ACM certificates** are assessed for **time to expiration** against a configurable threshold. Certificates close to end of validity or already expired are surfaced, covering those attached to services and, *if in scope*, unused ones.",
  "Risk": "Expired or near-expiry **TLS certificates** can break handshakes, causing **service outages** and failed API calls (**availability**). Emergency fixes raise misconfiguration risk, enabling disabled verification or weak ciphers, which allows **MITM** and data exposure (**confidentiality**/**integrity**).",

      "Other": "1. In the AWS Console, open Certificate Manager (ACM)\n2. If the expiring certificate is ACM-issued: select it and complete/restore validation (Create records in Route 53 or add the shown CNAME) so renewal can proceed\n3. If the expiring certificate is imported: click Import a certificate, upload the new certificate and private key, then save\n4. Update the service to use the new/renewed certificate:\n   - ALB/NLB: EC2 > Load Balancers > Listeners > Edit > Change certificate to the new ACM certificate\n   - CloudFront: Distributions > Edit > Viewer certificate > Select the new ACM certificate\n   - API Gateway: Custom domain names > Edit > Choose the new ACM certificate\n5. Verify the old certificate is no longer in use; delete it if not needed",

    "Recommendation": {
      "Text": "Adopt **automated certificate lifecycle management**: prefer **ACM-issued certs with auto-renewal**, or integrate imports with an automated renewal/rotation pipeline. Track expirations with alerts, enforce **least privilege** for cert operations, remove unused certs, and test rollovers to avoid downtime.",
