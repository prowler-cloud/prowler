  "Description": "**AWS IAM root user** activity is assessed by inspecting `last-used` timestamps for the root password and access keys. The finding indicates when the root identity has been used recently for console or programmatic access.",
  "Risk": "Recent **root usage** expands blast radius:\n- Data exfiltration (**confidentiality**)\n- Policy/key tampering (**integrity**)\n- Resource deletion and billing changes (**availability**)\nRoutine use reduces anomaly visibility and eases **account takeover** impact.",
