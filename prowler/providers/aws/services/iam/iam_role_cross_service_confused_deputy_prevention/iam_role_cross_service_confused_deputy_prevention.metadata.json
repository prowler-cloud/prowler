If the role doesn't support these fields, consider implementing alternative security measures, such as defining more restrictive resource-based policies or using service-specific trust policies, to limit the role's permissions and exposure. For detailed guidance, refer to AWS's documentation on preventing cross-service confused deputy issues.",
