  "Risk": "**Root access keys** provide unrestricted API access. If exposed or misused, attackers can:\n- Turn off logging and alter policies (**integrity**)\n- Read or export data (**confidentiality**)\n- Delete resources and lock out admins (**availability**)\nLong-lived keys can persist and may bypass console-only MFA.",
