  "Risk": "**Admin users without MFA** are vulnerable to single-factor compromise. Stolen or guessed credentials can yield full control, enabling privilege escalation, policy changes, data exfiltration, and destructive operations, impacting **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability**.",
