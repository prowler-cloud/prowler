  "Description": "**AWS root user** with active credentials is assessed for **MFA activation**. The evaluation considers whether the root identity has a password or access keys and whether **MFA is enabled**.\n\n*If centralized root access is enabled in Organizations, the presence of individual root credentials is also noted.*",
  "Risk": "Without **MFA**, compromise of the root password or access keys can lead to full **account takeover**. An attacker with root can disable protections, steal or delete data, change billing, and create persistent admins, undermining confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",

Apply **least privilege** with IAM Identity Center for admins, and use Organizations to **centralize root access** and eliminate long-lived root credentials.",
