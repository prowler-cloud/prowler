  "Description": "Ensure IAM policies that allow full \"*:*\" administrative privileges are not created, may be eventual consistent if an ephemeral resource is using it",
  "Risk": "IAM policies are the means by which privileges are granted to users, groups, or roles. It is recommended and considered a standard security advice to grant least privilegeâ€”that is, granting only the permissions required to perform a task. Determine what users need to do and then craft policies for them that let the users perform only those tasks instead of allowing full administrative privileges. Providing full administrative privileges instead of restricting to the minimum set of permissions that the user is required to do exposes the resources to potentially unwanted actions.",
