  "Description": "**IAM users** have identity-based policies attached directly (managed or inline) instead of inheriting permissions via **groups** or **roles**.",
  "Risk": "Directly attached user policies hinder centralized control and cause privilege creep. If a user is compromised, excessive rights enable data exposure, resource tampering, and lateral movement, harming **confidentiality** and **integrity**. Revocation is error-prone, weakening **separation of duties** and auditability.",
