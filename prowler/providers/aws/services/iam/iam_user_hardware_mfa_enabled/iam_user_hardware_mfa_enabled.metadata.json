  "Description": "**IAM users** are evaluated for **hardware MFA** enrollment, identifying physical tokens or security keys and distinguishing them from *virtual* or *SMS* MFA, as well as users without any MFA.",
  "Risk": "Without **hardware MFA**, authentication is weaker:\n- **SIM-swap** can bypass SMS\n- **Phishing** can steal TOTP from virtual apps\n- No MFA allows password-only takeover\nThis enables unauthorized console/API access, causing data exfiltration (C), privilege abuse (I), and service disruption (A).",

Enforce MFA for all access paths, apply **least privilege**, and provision multiple MFA devices per user for continuity.",
