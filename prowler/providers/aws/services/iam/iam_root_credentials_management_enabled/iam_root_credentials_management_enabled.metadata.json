  "Risk": "Without central control, member accounts can retain or recover long-term root credentials, weakening **confidentiality** and **integrity**.\n\nThreats include:\n- Account takeover via root email recovery\n- Persistent access through root keys\n- Unfixable lockouts from misconfigured policies\n- Bypass of **separation of duties**",
