  "Description": "**AWS CloudTrail trails** are evaluated for use of **SSE-KMS** with a customer-managed KMS key to encrypt delivered log files at rest in S3. Trails without a configured KMS key are identified. *Applies to single-Region and multi-Region trails.*",
  "Risk": "Absent a **customer-managed KMS key**, log protection relies only on storage permissions. Bucket misconfigurations or stolen credentials can expose audit data, aiding evasion and lateral movement. Missing key-level controls, rotation, and usage audit weaken **confidentiality** and **forensic integrity**.",
