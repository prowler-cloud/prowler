  "Description": "**AWS CloudTrail** has at least one trail with `logging` enabled in every region. A **multi-region trail** or a regional trail counts for coverage in that region.",
  "Risk": "Missing coverage in any region creates **visibility gaps**.\n\nAttackers can use lesser-monitored regions to run API actions, hide **unauthorized changes**, and exfiltrate data without audit trails, weakening **detective controls**, hindering **forensics**, and delaying response (confidentiality and integrity).",

Continuously monitor trail health to catch gaps.",
