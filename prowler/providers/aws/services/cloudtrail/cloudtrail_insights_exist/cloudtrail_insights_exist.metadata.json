  "Description": "**CloudTrail trails** that are logging are evaluated for **Insights** via `insight selectors`, which enable anomaly detection on management-event patterns (API call and error rates). The finding pinpoints logging trails where these selectors are missing.",
  "Risk": "Without **Insights**, abnormal API call or error rates can go unnoticed, delaying detection of credential abuse, privilege escalation, or runaway automation. Attackers may rapidly alter policies, delete resources, or exfiltrate data before response, impacting confidentiality and availability.",

Integrate alerts with monitoring and review anomalies regularly. Apply **defense in depth** and least privilege to reduce potential blast radius.",
