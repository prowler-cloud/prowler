  "Description": "CloudTrail log destination **S3 buckets** are inspected for ACL grants that expose data to the public `AllUsers` group.\n\nBuckets hosted in other accounts are flagged for out-of-scope review.",
  "Risk": "Exposed CloudTrail logs erode **confidentiality** and **integrity**.\n\nAdversaries can harvest API activity to map accounts, roles, and keys, enabling **reconnaissance** and evasion. If write is allowed, logs can be **poisoned** or deleted, thwarting investigations and compromising incident timelines.",
