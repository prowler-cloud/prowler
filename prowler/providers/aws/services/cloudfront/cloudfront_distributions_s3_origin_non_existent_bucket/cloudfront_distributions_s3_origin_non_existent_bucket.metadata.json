  "Risk": "**Dangling S3 origins** allow potential **bucket takeover**: an attacker could create the missing bucket and have CloudFront retrieve attacker-controlled objects *if access isn't restricted*.\n\nThis threatens **integrity** (content spoofing, cache poisoning) and **availability** (errors/timeouts), undermining user trust.",
