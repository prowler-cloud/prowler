  "Description": "**CloudFront distributions** are assessed for an associated **AWS WAF** web ACL that inspects and filters HTTP/S requests at the edge.\n\nThe finding highlights distributions without this web ACL association.",
  "Risk": "Absent **WAF** on Internet-facing distributions exposes apps to layer-7 threats: SQLi/XSS and bot abuse can cause data exfiltration (**confidentiality**), unauthorized actions (**integrity**), and request floods that overload origins (**availability**). It may also raise egress and compute costs.",
