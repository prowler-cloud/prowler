  "Description": "Check if CloudFront distributions are using SNI to serve HTTPS requests.",
  "Risk": "If SNI is not used, CloudFront will allocate a dedicated IP address for each SSL certificate, leading to higher costs and inefficient IP address utilization. This could also complicate scaling and managing multiple distributions, especially if your domain requires multiple SSL certificates.",
