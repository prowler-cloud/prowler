  "Description": "**EC2 instances** are evaluated for age while in `running` state. Instances launched beyond the configurable limit (`max_ec2_instance_age_in_days`, default `180`) are flagged as older than the allowed lifetime. Stopped instances are ignored.",
  "Risk": "Long-lived instances often run **unpatched OS and agents**, enabling:\n- Exploitation of known CVEs  loss of confidentiality\n- Privilege escalation and tampering  integrity compromise\n- Malware/crypto-mining and instability  reduced availability\n\nAged hosts also drift from baselines and impede response.",
