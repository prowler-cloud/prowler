  "Description": "Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to any port and not attached to a network interface with not allowed network interface types or instance owners. By default, the allowed network interface types are 'api_gateway_managed' and 'vpc_endpoint', and the allowed instance owners are 'amazon-elb', you can customize these values by setting the 'ec2_allowed_interface_types' and 'ec2_allowed_instance_owners' variables.",
  "Risk": "The security group allows all traffic from the internet to any port. This could allow an attacker to access the instance.",
