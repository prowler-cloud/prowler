  "Description": "**Default VPC security group** should have **no inbound or outbound rules**. This evaluates whether the group allows any traffic-ingress, egress, or self-referencing-instead of remaining empty.",
  "Risk": "Permissive rules in the **default security group** mean instances that inherit it can communicate widely. This enables **lateral movement**, **port scanning**, and **data exfiltration**; unrestricted egress aids **C2**. Confidentiality and integrity are reduced, and the blast radius of a compromise grows.",
