  "Description": "Evaluates if an Amazon EBS volume in in-use state is covered by a backup plan. The check fails if an EBS volume isn't covered by a backup plan. If you set the backupVaultLockCheck parameter equal to true, the control passes only if the EBS volume is backed up in an AWS Backup locked vault.",
  "Risk": "Without backup coverage, Amazon EBS volumes are vulnerable to data loss or deletion, reducing the resilience of your systems and making recovery from incidents more difficult.",
