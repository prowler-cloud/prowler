  "Description": "EC2 instances with security groups allowing inbound **Telnet** on `TCP 23` from the Internet are identified, including open IPv4/IPv6 sources like `0.0.0.0/0` and `::/0`.\n\nExposure is evaluated considering public IP assignment and subnet reachability.",
  "Risk": "Exposed **Telnet** weakens **confidentiality** and **integrity**: credentials and commands are plaintext, enabling interception and session hijacking. Attackers can brute-force to gain shell, run remote commands, exfiltrate data, and pivot laterally, also threatening **availability** through misuse or takeover.",

Use **defense in depth** with monitoring and strong authentication for any legacy needs.",
