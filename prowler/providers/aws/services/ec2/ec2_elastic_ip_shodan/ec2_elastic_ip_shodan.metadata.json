  "Description": "**EC2 Elastic IPs** are compared with **Shodan**'s index to identify publicly reachable addresses that have been scanned and cataloged, including metadata such as open ports, ISP, and geolocation",
  "Risk": "Being listed on **Shodan** confirms Internet exposure and reveals open services, versions, and banners. Adversaries can rapidly target these hosts for credential attacks and CVE exploits, threatening **confidentiality** (data access), **integrity** (system takeover), and **availability** (service disruption).",
