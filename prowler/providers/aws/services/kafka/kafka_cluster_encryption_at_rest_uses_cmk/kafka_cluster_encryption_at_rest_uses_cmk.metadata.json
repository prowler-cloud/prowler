  "Description": "Amazon MSK clusters are inspected for **encryption at rest** using a **customer-managed KMS key** for data volumes. Serverless clusters are inherently encrypted. Provisioned clusters are recognized only when the configured `DataVolumeKMSKeyId` corresponds to a customer-managed key.",
  "Risk": "Relying on service-managed keys weakens **confidentiality** and **accountability**: you can't enforce granular key policies, separation of duties, or independent rotation. This limits incident response (e.g., disabling the key for crypto-shredding) and reduces auditability, increasing impact of credential misuse or broker compromise.",
