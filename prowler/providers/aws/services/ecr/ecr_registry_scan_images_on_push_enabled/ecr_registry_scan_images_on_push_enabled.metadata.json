  "Description": "Amazon ECR registries with repositories are evaluated for image scanning configured as `scan on push` at the registry level, with scan rules that cover all repositories (no restrictive filters), for either **basic** or **enhanced** scanning.",
  "Risk": "Absent or filtered `scan on push` lets **vulnerable images** be pushed and deployed without timely detection, enabling exploitation of known CVEs (RCE, privilege escalation), supply chain compromise, and lateral movement - threatening workload integrity and data confidentiality.",

Prefer **enhanced scanning** for broader coverage, and pair with continuous scans when available. Integrate findings into CI/CD gates and alerts to enforce **defense in depth** and block promotion of risky images.",
