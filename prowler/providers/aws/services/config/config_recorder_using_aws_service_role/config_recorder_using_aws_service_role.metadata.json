  "Description": "**AWS Config recorders** are evaluated for use of the service‑linked IAM role `AWSServiceRoleForConfig` linked to `config.amazonaws.com` rather than a custom role.\n\nThe evaluation inspects active recorders and their role ARN to confirm the AWS‑managed service‑linked role is in use.",
  "Risk": "Using a custom or incorrect role can break recording or create blind spots, undermining the **integrity** and **availability** of configuration history. Over‑privileged roles weaken **least privilege**, increasing risk of unauthorized access, stealthy changes, and delayed incident response.",
