  "Risk": "Relative to Single-AZ deployment, Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced durability by further replicating data across AZs, and enhanced availability during planned system maintenance and unplanned service disruption by failing over automatically to the standby AZ. This allows you to continue accessing your data, and helps to protect your data against instance failure and AZ disruption.",
