  "Description": "**GuardDuty detectors** are evaluated for the presence of **High-severity findings**. This surfaces whether any detector currently has findings labeled `High` by GuardDuty.",
  "Risk": "Unresolved **High findings** often signal active compromise, enabling:\n- Data exfiltration and unauthorized access (confidentiality)\n- Privilege escalation and tampering (integrity)\n- Disruption via malware/crypto-mining (availability)\n\nAttackers can pivot laterally and persist if not contained.",
