  "Risk": "Without forwarding, visibility into AD security events is lost, delaying detection of suspicious authentications, policy changes, or privilege grants. Attackers can escalate and persist unnoticed, risking unauthorized access (confidentiality) and identity/policy manipulation (integrity), while hampering forensics and response.",
