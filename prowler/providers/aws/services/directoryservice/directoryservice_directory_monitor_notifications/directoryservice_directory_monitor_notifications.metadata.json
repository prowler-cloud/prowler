  "Description": "**AWS Directory Service** directories are associated with **Amazon SNS topics** to send status change notifications (e.g., `Active`  `Impaired`).\n\nThe evaluation looks for directories that have SNS event topics configured for monitoring alerts.",
  "Risk": "Missing directory notifications reduces visibility into health changes, causing delayed response to `Impaired` states. This threatens availability of authentication, Kerberos/LDAP lookups, and domain joins; increases MTTR; and can enable silent replication or trust failures that impact integrity across dependent workloads.",
