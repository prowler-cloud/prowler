  "Description": "**AWS Directory Service directories** are evaluated for **RADIUS-backed multi-factor authentication**, confirming that MFA is configured and the RADIUS integration is active.",
  "Risk": "Without **RADIUS MFA**, directory-based sign-ins to AWS-integrated services rely on a single factor, enabling credential stuffing and phishing to succeed. Compromised passwords can grant unauthorized access, drive data exfiltration, and enable privilege escalation, undermining confidentiality and integrity.",

Use **defense in depth** with segmentation and session controls to limit lateral movement and reduce blast radius.",
