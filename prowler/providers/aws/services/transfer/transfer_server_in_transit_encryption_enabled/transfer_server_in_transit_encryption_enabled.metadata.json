  "Description": "Ensure that your Transfer Family servers have encryption in transit enabled.",
  "Risk": "Using FTP for endpoint connections leaves data in transit unencrypted, making it susceptible to interception by attackers. FTP lacks encryption, which exposes your data to person-in-the-middle and other interception risks. Adopting encrypted protocols such as SFTP, FTPS, or AS2 provides a layer of protection that helps secure sensitive data during transfer.",
