  "Description": "**Amazon EFS file systems** are assessed for automated backups configured via the `backup policy`. The finding highlights file systems where backups are not enabled or are being disabled.",
  "Risk": "Absence of EFS backups degrades **availability** and **integrity**. Accidental deletion, ransomware, or misconfiguration can wipe or corrupt data with no recovery path. Without point-in-time copies, RPO/RTO suffer and localized incidents can become prolonged outages and irreversible loss.",
