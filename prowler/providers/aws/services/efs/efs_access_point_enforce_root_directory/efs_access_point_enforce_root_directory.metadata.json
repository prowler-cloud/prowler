  "Description": "**Amazon EFS access points** are evaluated to ensure they enforce a non-root directory. The check identifies access points whose configured root directory `Path` is `/`, meaning clients would mount the file system's root instead of a scoped subdirectory.",
  "Risk": "Exposing the file system root via an access point undermines **confidentiality** and **integrity** by allowing traversal beyond intended datasets. Attackers or misconfigured apps could:\n- Read sensitive directories\n- Modify or delete shared data\n- Pivot across tenants, impacting **availability**",

      "Text": "Apply **least privilege**: set each access point `Path` to a dedicated subdirectory and avoid `/`.\n- Use per-application access points\n- Enforce POSIX identity and directory permissions\n- Layer controls (network segmentation, monitoring) for **defense in depth**",
