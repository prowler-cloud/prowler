  "Description": "**Amazon EFS** file systems are assessed for **multi-AZ resilience**: Regional type (no `availability_zone_id`) with mount targets in more than one Availability Zone. Single-AZ (One Zone) or Regional with only one mount target is identified for attention.",
  "Risk": "Concentrating access through a single AZ or a lone mount target reduces **availability**. An AZ outage can sever client connectivity, causing downtime and I/O errors. A single mount target also forces cross-AZ traffic, increasing latency and costs and undermining **resilience** and seamless failover.",

If File system type shows Regional: open the Network tab > Mount targets > Manage mount targets > Add mount target\n3. Select a subnet in a different Availability Zone and save\n4. If File system type shows One Zone: create a new EFS with File system type = Regional and create mount targets in at least two AZs; remount clients to the new file system and decommission the old one",

      "Text": "Use **Regional EFS** and create mount targets in each required **Availability Zone** to remove single points of failure and keep clients local to their AZ. Avoid One Zone for critical data. Periodically review mount target distribution to uphold **high availability** and **fault tolerance**.",
