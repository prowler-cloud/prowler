  "Description": "**Amazon EFS file system** has **encryption at rest** enabled using AWS KMS to protect file data and metadata stored on the service",
  "Risk": "Without encryption at rest, EFS contents can be read from storage media, backups, or compromised hosts, eroding **confidentiality** and enabling offline exfiltration. Privileged compromise also allows covert data harvesting or manipulation, threatening **integrity** of files.",
