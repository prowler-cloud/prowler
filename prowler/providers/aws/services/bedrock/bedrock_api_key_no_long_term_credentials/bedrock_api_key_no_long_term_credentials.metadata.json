  "Description": "**Bedrock API keys** are evaluated for **lifetime** and **expiration**.\n\nThe finding identifies keys that are long-lived, set to expire far in the future, or configured to `never expire`, and distinguishes them from keys that have already expired.",
  "Risk": "Long-lived or non-expiring keys enable persistent access if compromised.\n- Confidentiality: unauthorized inference and exposure of prompts/outputs\n- Availability/Cost: uncontrolled usage and spend spikes\n- Integrity: actions can continue without timely revocation or rotation",
