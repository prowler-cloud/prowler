  "Description": "**Bedrock model invocation logs** are stored in encrypted destinations: **S3 buckets** with bucket encryption and **CloudWatch Logs** groups protected by an AWS KMS key.\n\nThis evaluates whether configured log targets enforce encryption at rest for request/response content and associated metadata.",
  "Risk": "Without encryption at rest, prompts, outputs, images, and token/usage metadata in logs can be read if S3 or CloudWatch storage or replicas are accessed by unauthorized principals.\n\nImpacts:\n- Loss of data **confidentiality**\n- Secret or PII exposure enabling **account abuse**\n- Operational intel for **lateral movement**",
