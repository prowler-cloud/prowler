  "Description": "**AWS CodeBuild projects** are assessed for recent activity using the last build invocation timestamp. Projects not invoked within `90 days` or never built are treated as **inactive**.",
  "Risk": "**Inactive projects** increase **attack surface**. Dormant webhooks or **source credentials** can be abused, and attached **IAM roles** may retain excessive permissions. Stale configs can expose **secrets** in env vars or logs, threatening build **integrity** and data **confidentiality**, while adding avoidable cost and operational sprawl.",

Revoke unused webhooks, tokens, and service roles; rotate any secrets. Enforce **least privilege**, tagging, and periodic audits to reduce **attack surface** and keep the build environment tidy and defensible.",
