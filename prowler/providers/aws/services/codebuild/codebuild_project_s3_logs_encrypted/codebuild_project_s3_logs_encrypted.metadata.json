  "Description": "Encryption of data at rest is a recommended best practice to add a layer of access management around your data. Encrypting the logs at rest reduces the risk that a user not authenticated by AWS will access the data stored on disk. It adds another set of access controls to limit the ability of unauthorized users to access the data.",
  "Risk": "If the logs are not encrypted, sensitive information could be exposed to unauthorized users.",
