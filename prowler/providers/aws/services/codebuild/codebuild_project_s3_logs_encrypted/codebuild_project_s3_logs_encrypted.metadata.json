  "Risk": "Unencrypted build logs jeopardize **confidentiality**. Logs can include secrets, environment data, and error traces. If the bucket is misconfigured or storage is accessed, attackers can harvest credentials and map the pipeline, enabling **lateral movement** and build tampering that impacts **integrity**.",
