  "Description": "Ensure that your Amazon EKS cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint is not publicly accessible from the Internet in order to avoid exposing private data and minimizing security risks.",
  "Risk": "By default, this API server endpoint is publicly accessible, meaning any machine on the internet can potentially connect to your EKS cluster using its public endpoint. This exposes your cluster to a higher risk of malicious activities and attacks.",
