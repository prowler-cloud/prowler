  "Description": "**EventBridge event bus** has a **resource policy** that grants **cross-account event delivery** to principals outside the account, including broad or public access.\n\nFocus is on buses whose policies permit external accounts to send events.",
  "Risk": "**Cross-account event injection** can erode **integrity** and **availability**. Spoofed events may trigger rules and invoke downstream targets, causing unintended actions, data exposure via targets, lateral movement through over-privileged roles, and cost or service disruption from event floods.",
