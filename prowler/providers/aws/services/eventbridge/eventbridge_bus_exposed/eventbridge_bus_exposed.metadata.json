  "Description": "EventBridge event bus resource policy is evaluated for **public access**, such as a `Principal: \"*\"` or overly broad conditions that allow any AWS account to publish events or manage rules on the bus.",
  "Risk": "Publicly accessible event buses enable **event injection** and unauthorized rule changes, undermining **integrity** and enabling **lateral movement**. Attackers can trigger downstream targets, causing **data exposure**, service disruption, and unexpected **costs** through high-volume events.",

Avoid `Principal: \"*\"`.\n\nUse **defense in depth** with rule patterns that include the expected `account`. Monitor policy changes and bus activity.",
