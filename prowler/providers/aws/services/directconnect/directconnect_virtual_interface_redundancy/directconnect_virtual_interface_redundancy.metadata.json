  "Risk": "This check alerts you if any Direct Connect gateway or virtual private gateway isn't configured with virtual interfaces across at least two distinct Direct Connect locations. Lack of location resiliency can result in unexpected downtime during maintenance, a fiber cut, a device failure, or a complete location failure.",
