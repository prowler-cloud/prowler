  "Description": "**Direct Connect gateways** and **virtual private gateways** are assessed for **interface redundancy**: multiple virtual interfaces (`VIFs`) distributed across more than one **Direct Connect connection**.\n\n*Gateways with only one VIF or with all VIFs on a single connection are identified.*",
  "Risk": "Missing connection diversity undermines **availability**. A single device, fiber, or location failure can cut on-prem to VPC connectivity, causing **outages**, **packet loss**, or routing blackholes. Fallback to internet VPN can add latency and throttle throughput, delaying recovery and impacting operations.",
