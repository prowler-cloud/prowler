  "Description": "**AWS Direct Connect** connectivity is provisioned with **connection and location redundancy**-multiple connections spread across **at least two distinct Direct Connect locations** in each Region.",
  "Risk": "Missing **connection/location redundancy** creates a **single point of failure**, degrading **availability**. A router, fiber, or site outage can sever private paths to AWS, stalling app traffic, data replication, and admin access, leading to timeouts or extended downtime until alternate paths are restored.",

      "Other": "1. In the AWS Console, go to Direct Connect > Connections\n2. Click Create connection\n3. Region: select the Region where the existing connection resides\n4. Name: enter <example_resource_name>\n5. Location: select a different Direct Connect location than your existing connection\n6. Bandwidth: choose a supported value (e.g., 1 Gbps)\n7. Click Create connection",
      "Terraform": "```hcl\n# Create an additional Direct Connect connection in a different location\nresource \"aws_dx_connection\" \"example\" {\n  name      = \"<example_resource_name>\"\n  bandwidth = \"1Gbps\"\n  location  = \"<NEW_DX_LOCATION_CODE>\" # Critical: choose a different DX location in the same Region to achieve location redundancy\n}\n```"
    },
    "Recommendation": {
      "Text": "Apply **redundancy** and **defense in depth**:\n- Deploy 2 Direct Connect connections across **two distinct locations**\n- Use **dynamic, active/active routing** for automatic failover\n- Ensure **provider/device diversity**\n- Size capacity so one link loss doesn't overload remaining paths\n- Consider a **VPN** as tertiary backup",
