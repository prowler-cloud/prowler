  "Description": "Ensure that Amazon Storage Gateway service is using AWS KMS Customer Master Keys (CMKs) instead of AWS managed-keys (i.e. default keys) for file share data encryption, in order to have a fine-grained control over data-at-rest encryption/decryption process and meet compliance requirements. An AWS Storage Gateway file share is a file system mount point backed by Amazon S3 cloud storage.",
  "Risk": "This could provide an avenue for unauthorized access to your data by not having fine-grained control over data-at-rest encryption/decryption process and meet compliance requirements.",
