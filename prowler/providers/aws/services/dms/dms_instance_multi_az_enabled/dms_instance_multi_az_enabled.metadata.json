  "Description": "**AWS DMS replication instances** are evaluated for **Multi-AZ** configuration. Instances with `multi_az` enabled are treated as having a cross-AZ standby; those without it are identified as single-AZ.",
  "Risk": "Without **Multi-AZ**, a single-AZ failure or maintenance event can halt migrations, causing extended downtime (**availability**) and replication gaps or rollbacks (**integrity**). Tasks may stall, increase cutover risk, and require manual recovery when the replication instance is unavailable.",
