  "Description": "**AWS DMS replication instances** are evaluated for **public exposure**. Exposure is identified when `PubliclyAccessible` is enabled and an attached security group allows inbound traffic from any address. Private or allowlisted instances are not considered exposed.",
  "Risk": "Publicly reachable replication instances threaten:\n- Confidentiality: migration data and credentials can be intercepted or exfiltrated.\n- Integrity: attackers may alter tasks or inject records.\n- Availability: abuse or DDoS can stall replication and delay cutovers.",
