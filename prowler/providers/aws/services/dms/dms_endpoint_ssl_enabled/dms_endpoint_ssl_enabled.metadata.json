  "Description": "**AWS DMS endpoints** have their SSL/TLS mode inspected; any value other than `none` denotes encrypted connections between the replication instance and databases.\n\nSupported modes include `require`, `verify-ca`, and `verify-full`.",
  "Risk": "Without TLS, data in transit can be read or altered, affecting:\n- **Confidentiality** via packet sniffing and credential leakage\n- **Integrity** through **MITM** tampering of migration streams\n- **Availability** from session hijack or task disruption",
