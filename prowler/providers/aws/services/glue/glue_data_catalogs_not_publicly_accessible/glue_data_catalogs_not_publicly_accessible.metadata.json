  "Description": "**AWS Glue Data Catalog** resource policies are assessed for configurations that expose the catalog to anyone, such as `Principal: *`, broad resource scopes, or permissive conditions.\n\nThe finding highlights catalogs made public through overly permissive resource-based access.",
  "Risk": "Public catalog access lets unauthorized actors enumerate schemas, S3 locations, and connection metadata, weakening **confidentiality**. If writes are exposed, attackers can alter databases/tables, corrupt lineage, and disrupt jobs and queries, harming **integrity** and **availability**, and enabling lateral movement to data stores.",
