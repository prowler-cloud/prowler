  "Description": "**Amazon SNS topics** are assessed for **server-side encryption** with **AWS KMS**. Topics lacking a configured KMS key (e.g., missing `kms_master_key_id`) are identified as unencrypted at rest.",
  "Risk": "Without KMS-backed SSE, SNS stores message bodies unencrypted at rest, undermining **confidentiality**.\n\nPrivileged insiders or compromised service components could access plaintext during persistence windows, causing data exposure. You also lose KMS controls such as key policies, rotation, and detailed audit trails.",
