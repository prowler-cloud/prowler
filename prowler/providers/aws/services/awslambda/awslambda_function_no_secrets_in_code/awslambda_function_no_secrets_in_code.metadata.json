  "Description": "**Lambda function code** is analyzed for **embedded secrets** across files in the deployment package, detecting patterns like API keys, passwords, tokens, and connection strings. Findings reference file names and line numbers where potential secrets appear.",
  "Risk": "**Hardcoded secrets** undermine confidentiality and integrity: if code, layers, or artifacts are exposed, attackers can reuse credentials to access databases, APIs, or cloud resources, enabling data exfiltration and unauthorized changes.\n\nRotation is harder, increasing dwell time and blast radius of compromises.",
