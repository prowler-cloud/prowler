  "Description": "This check verifies whether an AWS Lambda function is deployed within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Deploying Lambda functions inside a VPC improves security by allowing control over the network environment, reducing the exposure to public internet threats.",
  "Risk": "Lambda functions not deployed in a VPC may expose your application to increased security risks, including unauthorized access and data breaches. Without the network isolation provided by a VPC, your Lambda functions are more vulnerable to attacks.",
