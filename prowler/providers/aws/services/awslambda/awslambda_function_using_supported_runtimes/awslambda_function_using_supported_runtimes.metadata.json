  "Risk": "Unmaintained runtimes lack security patches, exposing code and libraries to known CVEs (**confidentiality, integrity**).\n\nDeprecation can block create/update and break builds, causing failed deployments or runtime errors (**availability**). Tooling may stop supporting builds, slowing fixes and recovery.",
