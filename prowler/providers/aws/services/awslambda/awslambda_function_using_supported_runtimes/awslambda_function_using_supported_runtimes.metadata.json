  "Risk": "If you have functions running on a runtime that will be deprecated in the next 60 days; Lambda notifies you by email that you should prepare by migrating your function to a supported runtime. In some cases; such as security issues that require a backwards-incompatible update; or software that does not support a long-term support (LTS) schedule; advance notice might not be possible. After a runtime is deprecated; Lambda might retire it completely at any time by disabling invocation. Deprecated runtimes are not eligible for security updates or technical support.",
