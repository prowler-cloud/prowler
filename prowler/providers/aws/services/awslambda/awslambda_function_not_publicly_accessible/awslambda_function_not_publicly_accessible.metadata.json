  "Description": "**AWS Lambda** function resource-based policies are assessed for **public access**. The finding identifies policies with wildcard or empty `Principal` that allow actions like `lambda:InvokeFunction` to any principal.",
  "Risk": "**Public invocation** lets outsiders run code under the function's IAM role.\n\nImpacts:\n- **Confidentiality**: data exfiltration via backend access\n- **Integrity**: unauthorized state changes from side effects\n- **Availability/cost**: invocation floods causing throttling and spend spikes",

      "Text": "Remove public principals from function policies. Grant access only to specific accounts, roles, or services using fixed ARNs and **least privilege**.
