  "Description": "**Amazon DocumentDB clusters** are evaluated for **automated backups** and an adequate **backup retention period**. Clusters should have `backup_retention_period` set to at least the configured minimum (default `7` days). Values of `0` indicate backups are disabled; values below the threshold are considered insufficient.",
  "Risk": "Without adequate backups, clusters can't be reliably restored. Accidental deletes, logical corruption, or ransomware may cause irreversible data loss once a short retention window expires, leading to prolonged outages, missed RPO/RTO, and limited ability to roll back malicious or erroneous changes.",
