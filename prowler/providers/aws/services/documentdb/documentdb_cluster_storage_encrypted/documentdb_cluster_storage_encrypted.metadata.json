  "Description": "**Amazon DocumentDB clusters** are assessed for **storage encryption at rest** via the cluster's `encrypted` setting.\n\nIt identifies clusters where data volumes, automated backups, and snapshots aren't protected by AWS KMS-managed encryption.",
  "Risk": "Without at-rest encryption, cluster data, snapshots, and backups can be read in plaintext if copies are leaked, mis-shared, or underlying storage is accessed. This harms **confidentiality**, enables offline analysis and data exfiltration, and widens the blast radius of insider or backup repository compromise.",
