  "Description": "**DynamoDB tables** are evaluated for inclusion in an **AWS Backup backup plan** through resource assignments, including explicit tables, resource-type wildcards, or all-resources coverage.\n\nThe result indicates whether a table is governed by scheduled backups and retention defined by the plan.",
  "Risk": "Without a backup plan, table data lacks governed copies, harming **availability** and **integrity**. Accidental deletes, corrupt writes, or malicious actions can become unrecoverable, and RPO/RTO worsen. You also forfeit cross-Region/account copies and immutability features, increasing downtime and data loss.",
