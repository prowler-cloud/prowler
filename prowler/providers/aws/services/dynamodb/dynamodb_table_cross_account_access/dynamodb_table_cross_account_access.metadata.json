  "Risk": "Allowing other accounts to access a table affects:\n- **Confidentiality**: unauthorized reads/data exfiltration\n- **Integrity**: writes or deletes by external principals\n- **Availability**: capacity exhaustion and throttling\n- **Cost**: owner pays for external requests\n\nIf public principals are allowed, exposure can be unrestricted.",
