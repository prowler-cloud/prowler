  "Description": "**AWS Site-to-Site VPN** connections have two IPsec tunnels. This evaluates tunnel status and detects when any tunnel is not `UP`, indicating whether both tunnels are concurrently available for high availability.",
  "Risk": "With only one active tunnel or none, the link loses redundancy, degrading **availability** and increasing the chance of outages, session drops, or route blackholing. Failover cannot occur, disrupting critical workloads and cross-environment operations.",

For each tunnel (1 and 2), choose Actions > Download configuration, select your device/vendor, and download the config\n4. On your customer gateway device, configure BOTH tunnels using the downloaded parameters (pre-shared key, IKE/IPsec settings, inside CIDR, and routing/BGP as applicable)\n5. If your device requires different parameters, in the AWS console choose Actions > Modify VPN tunnel options, select the tunnel outside IP, adjust only the necessary options (for example IKE version or pre-shared key), and Save\n6. Wait a few minutes and verify both tunnels show Status: UP under Tunnel details",

      "Text": "Maintain both tunnels healthy and ready for failover:\n- Deploy redundant customer gateways and resilient routing\n- Monitor tunnel health with alerts\n- Periodically test failover and document runbooks\n\nApply **high availability** and **defense-in-depth** to avoid single points of failure.",
