  "Description": "**VPC endpoint policies** are assessed for restriction to configured **trusted AWS accounts**. If `Principal` values (including `*`) or account ARNs permit non-trusted principals, or conditions aren't sufficiently restrictive, the endpoint is identified. *Endpoints without editable policies are excluded.*",
  "Risk": "Non-trusted principals using your endpoint can access AWS services as if from your VPC, weakening segmentation. This enables unauthorized reads/writes and data exfiltration from resources tied to the endpoint, harming **confidentiality** and **integrity**, and potentially increasing **costs**.",
