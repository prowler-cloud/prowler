  "Description": "**AWS VPC peering** route tables are assessed for **least-privilege routing**. Routes that target `0.0.0.0/0` or an entire peer VPC CIDR are considered overly broad; only specific subnets or narrower prefixes should be advertised across the peering link.",
  "Risk": "Broad peering routes expand cross-VPC reachability, enabling lateral movement and unauthorized discovery, harming **confidentiality** and **integrity**. Using `0.0.0.0/0` or full-CIDR paths also increases misrouting with overlapping ranges, reducing network **availability**.",
