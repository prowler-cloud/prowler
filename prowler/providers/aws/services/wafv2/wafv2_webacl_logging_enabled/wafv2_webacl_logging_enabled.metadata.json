  "Risk": "Without **WAF logging**, visibility into allowed/blocked requests is lost, degrading detection and response. **SQLi**, **credential stuffing**, and **bot/DDoS probes** can go unnoticed, risking data exposure (C), undetected rule misuse (I), and service instability from unseen abuse (A).",
