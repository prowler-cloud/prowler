  "Description": "**ECS services** are assessed for automatic public IP assignment via the `assignPublicIp` setting in their network configuration.\n\nThe finding indicates whether tasks launched by the service receive a public IP or are limited to private addressing.",
  "Risk": "Automatic **public IPs** make tasks directly reachable from the Internet, enabling:\n- Port scanning and remote exploitation\n- Brute-force against admin endpoints\n- Data exfiltration via exposed APIs\nThis jeopardizes **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability**, and can facilitate lateral movement within the VPC.",

Apply **defense in depth** (WAF, TLS, monitoring) and segment networks to minimize blast radius.",
