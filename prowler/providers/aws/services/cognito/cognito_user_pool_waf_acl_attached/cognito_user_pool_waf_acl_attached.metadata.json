  "Description": "Amazon Cognito user pools are evaluated for an association with an **AWS WAFv2 web ACL** that filters and controls requests to the hosted UI and public user pool API endpoints.",
  "Risk": "Without a web ACL, Cognito endpoints lack layer-7 filtering, enabling:\n- Credential stuffing and account enumeration\n- Bot abuse and high-rate requests degrading service\n- Malicious payload probes\n\nThis threatens **availability**, risks unauthorized access to user data (**confidentiality**), and undermines session **integrity**.",
