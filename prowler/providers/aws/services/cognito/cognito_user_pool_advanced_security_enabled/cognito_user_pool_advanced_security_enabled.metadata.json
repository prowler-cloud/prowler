  "Description": "**Amazon Cognito user pools** are evaluated for **Threat protection (advanced security)** mode: `ENFORCED` (full-function) vs `AUDIT` or disabled. This indicates whether adaptive risk responses and compromised-credential checks are applied during authentication.",
  "Risk": "Without enforced threat protection, risky sign-ins aren't blocked-only logged-enabling credential stuffing, brute force, and account takeover. This threatens confidentiality and integrity via unauthorized access and token misuse, and can degrade availability through automated abuse.",
