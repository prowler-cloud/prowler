  "Description": "User pools allow you to configure a password policy for your user pool to specify requirements for user passwords. You can require that passwords have a minimum length, contain at least one uppercase letter, and contain at least one number. You can also require that passwords have at least one special character. You can also set the password policy to require that passwords be case-sensitive.",
  "Risk": "If the password policy for your user pool does not require at least one uppercase letter, it may be easier for an attacker to guess or crack user passwords.",
