  "Description": "**Amazon Cognito user pools** are assessed for a password policy that includes a **lowercase character requirement**. Pools with `require_lowercase` set are distinguished from those without a policy, which inherently lack this requirement.",
  "Risk": "Absent a **lowercase requirement** reduces password complexity and the overall **keyspace**, making **brute-force** and credential stuffing more feasible. Successful guessing enables account takeover, exposing user data and tokens and permitting profile changes, harming **confidentiality** and **integrity**.",

      "Text": "Enforce a strong password policy with `require_lowercase: true`, adequate length, and mixed character types. Complement with **defense in depth**: enable **MFA**, apply rate limiting or lockout for failed attempts, and block common passwords. Review regularly to match business risk and user population.",
