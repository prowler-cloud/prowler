  "Description": "**Amazon Cognito identity pools** are evaluated for **guest access** to unauthenticated identities. The assessment considers the `allow_unauthenticated_identities` setting and whether an unauthenticated role can be assumed by guests.",
  "Risk": "With **guest access**, unauthenticated users receive temporary credentials, reducing **confidentiality** and **integrity** controls. Overly permissive unauthenticated roles enable data reads/writes, API abuse, and resource consumption, risking **data exposure**, unauthorized changes, and **cost amplification**.",
