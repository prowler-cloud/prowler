  "Risk": "Without **deletion protection**, any principal with delete rights can remove a user pool in one action, causing immediate **authentication outages**. Identities and configurations are lost, breaking sign-ins and tokens, harming **availability** and **integrity**, and prolonging recovery if exports/backups are stale.",
