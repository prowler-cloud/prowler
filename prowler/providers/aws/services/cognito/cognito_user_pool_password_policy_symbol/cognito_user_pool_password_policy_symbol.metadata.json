  "Risk": "Absent a **symbol requirement**, passwords have lower entropy, increasing success of **brute force** and **credential stuffing**.\n\nCompromised accounts enable unauthorized token issuance, data access, and profile changes, impacting **confidentiality** and **integrity** across apps relying on the pool.",
