  "Description": "Temporary passwords are set by the administrator and are used to allow users to sign in and change their password. Temporary passwords are valid for a limited period of time, after which they expire. Temporary passwords are used when an administrator creates a new user account or resets a user password. The temporary password expiration period is the length of time that the temporary password is valid. The default value is 7 days. You can set the expiration period to a value between 0 and 365 days.",
  "Risk": "If the temporary password expiration period is too long, it increases the risk of unauthorized access to the user account. If the temporary password expiration period is too short, it increases the risk of users being unable to sign in and change their password.",
