When you enable token revocation, Amazon Cognito automatically revokes tokens for users who sign out or are deleted. This helps protect your users' data and prevent unauthorized access to your resources.",
  "Risk": "If token revocation is not enabled, users' tokens will not be revoked when they sign out or are deleted. This can lead to unauthorized access to your resources.",
