  "Description": "**Glacier vault** access policy is evaluated for exposure to **public principals**. The finding highlights `Allow` statements that grant access to `Principal: '*'` (including wildcard forms), and notes when a vault lacks a policy.",
  "Risk": "Publicly grantable vault access undermines **confidentiality** and **integrity**. Anyone could list, retrieve, or delete archives, leading to data exposure or loss. Attackers may also trigger large retrieval operations, degrading **availability** and driving unexpected costs.",
