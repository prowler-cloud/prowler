  "Description": "**RDS DB instances** are assessed for **internet exposure** using the `PubliclyAccessible` setting, security group ingress to the DB port from any address, and whether subnets are **public**. Instances that combine an internet-facing endpoint, open ingress, and public subnets are identified.",
  "Risk": "An internet-reachable database invites:\n- Brute-force and vulnerability probing, risking **availability** and **integrity**\n- Unauthorized queries and dumps leading to **confidentiality** loss\n\nCompromise can enable **lateral movement** and persistence within the VPC.",
