      "Text": "WorkSpaces is integrated with the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). This enables you to encrypt storage volumes of WorkSpaces using AWS KMS Key. When you launch a WorkSpace you can encrypt the root volume (for Microsoft Windows - the C drive, for Linux - /) and the user volume (for Windows - the D drive, for Linux - /home). Doing so ensures that the data stored at rest - disk I/O to the volume - and snapshots created from the volumes are all encrypted",
