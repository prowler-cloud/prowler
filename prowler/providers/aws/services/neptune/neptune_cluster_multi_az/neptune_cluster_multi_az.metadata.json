  "Description": "Amazon Neptune DB clusters are evaluated for `Multi-AZ` deployment by checking whether the cluster has read-replica instances distributed across multiple Availability Zones.\n\nA failing result indicates the cluster is deployed in a single AZ and lacks read-replicas that enable automatic promotion and cross-AZ failover.",
  "Risk": "**Single-AZ deployment** creates a clear availability single point of failure.\n\n- **Availability**: AZ outage or maintenance can cause prolonged downtime until the primary is rebuilt.\n- **Integrity/Recovery**: Manual recovery increases risk of configuration errors and longer RTOs, impacting operations and compliance.",
