  "Description": "*Neptune DB manual cluster snapshot* is evaluated to determine if its restore attributes allow access to *all AWS accounts* (public).\n\nA **FAIL** means the snapshot is publicly shared and can be copied or restored by any AWS account; **PASS** means it is not shared publicly.",
  "Risk": "**Public snapshots** compromise confidentiality of stored data and metadata.\n\nAttackers or third parties can:\n- copy or restore snapshots to external accounts\n- access sensitive data contained in the snapshot\n\nThis enables data exfiltration and compliance violations.",
