  "Description": "**Application Load Balancers** that are **internet-facing** are evaluated for an associated **AWS Shield Advanced** protection. Scope includes ALBs of type application with external exposure.",
  "Risk": "Without enhanced DDoS protection, internet-facing ALBs are exposed to volumetric L3/L4 floods and HTTP L7 floods, compromising **availability** via outages and latency spikes. Sudden scaling can raise **costs**, while reduced visibility and response support extend disruption across dependent services.",

      "Text": "Register internet-facing ALBs as **Shield Advanced protected resources** to strengthen **availability**. Use defense-in-depth: pair with **AWS WAF** for L7 filtering and rate limits, group related assets, enable health-based detection and proactive engagement, and enforce least-privilege IAM with continuous monitoring.",
