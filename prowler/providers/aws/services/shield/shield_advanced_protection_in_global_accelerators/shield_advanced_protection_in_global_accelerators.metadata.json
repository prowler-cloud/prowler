  "Description": "**AWS Global Accelerator** accelerators are assessed for enrollment in **Shield Advanced** as `protected resources`, indicating whether enhanced DDoS coverage is configured for each accelerator.",
  "Risk": "Without **Shield Advanced**, Global Accelerators are more vulnerable to volumetric and protocol **DDoS** that can exhaust capacity, causing **availability** loss, elevated **latency**, and disrupted failover. Limited visibility and no SRT support prolong incidents and can trigger unexpected **cost** spikes from malicious traffic.",

      "Text": "Add each Global Accelerator as a `protected resource` in **Shield Advanced**.
