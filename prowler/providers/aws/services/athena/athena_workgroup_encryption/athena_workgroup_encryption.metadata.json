  "Risk": "Unencrypted query outputs can be read at rest by unintended principals through S3 misconfigurations or cross-account access.\n\nImpact: **Confidentiality loss**, enabling **data exfiltration** and supporting **lateral movement** by exposing sensitive fields outside intended boundaries.",
