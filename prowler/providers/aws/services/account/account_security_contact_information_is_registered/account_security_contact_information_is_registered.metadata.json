  "Risk": "Missing or outdated **security contact** can delay or prevent AWS advisories from reaching responders, increasing risk to:\n- Confidentiality: data exfiltration from undetected compromise\n- Integrity: unauthorized changes persist longer\n- Availability: resource abuse (e.g., cryptomining) and outages",
