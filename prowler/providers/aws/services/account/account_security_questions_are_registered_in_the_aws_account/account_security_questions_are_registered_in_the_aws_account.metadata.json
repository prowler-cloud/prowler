  "Description": "[DEPRECATED] **AWS account root** configuration may include legacy **security challenge questions** for support identity verification. This evaluates whether those questions are set on the account. *New configuration is discontinued by AWS and remaining support for this feature is time-limited.*",
  "Risk": "Absence of these questions can limit support-assisted recovery if root credentials or MFA are lost, reducing **availability** and slowing **incident response**. Reliance on KBA also weakens **confidentiality** due to **social engineering**. Treat this as a recovery gap and adopt stronger, phishing-resistant factors.",
