  "Risk": "Missing or shared contacts can delay response to abuse alerts, credential compromise, or billing anomalies, reducing **availability** (possible AWS traffic throttling) and raising **confidentiality** and **integrity** risk through extended exposure. If AWS cannot reach you, urgent mitigation may disrupt service.",
