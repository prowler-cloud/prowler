  "Description": "**AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery** is assessed per Region to verify the service is **initialized** and that at least one **recovery or drill job** exists, demonstrating that failover has been exercised.",
  "Risk": "Without DRS enabled or any prior jobs, workloads are **unprotected and untested**, undermining **availability**.\nDuring outages or ransomware, recovery may be delayed or fail, increasing RTO/RPO, causing **data loss** and prolonged downtime.",
