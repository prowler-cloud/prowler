  "Description": "**Firewall Manager** policies in the administrator account are evaluated for organization-wide compliance. The assessment reviews each policy's account-level status and flags entries marked `NON_COMPLIANT` or unset. It also identifies when no effective policies exist within the administrator scope.",
  "Risk": "Policy drift or absence leaves in-scope resources without enforced controls, degrading **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability**. Missing WAF, Shield, security group, or network firewall baselines can enable DDoS exposure, unsafe routes, and open access, leading to unauthorized entry and data exfiltration.",
