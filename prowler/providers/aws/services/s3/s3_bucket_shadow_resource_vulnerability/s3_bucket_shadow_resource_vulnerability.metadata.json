  "ResourceType": "AwsS3Bucket",
  "Description": "Checks for S3 buckets with predictable names that could be hijacked by an attacker before legitimate use, leading to data leakage or other security breaches.",
  "Risk": "An attacker can pre-create S3 buckets with predictable names used by various AWS services. When a legitimate user's service attempts to use that bucket, it may inadvertently write sensitive data to the attacker-controlled bucket, leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or even remote code execution.",

      "Other": "Manually verify the ownership of any flagged S3 buckets. If a bucket is not owned by your account, investigate its origin and purpose. If it is not a legitimate resource, you should avoid using services that may interact with it.",

    },
    "Recommendation": {
      "Text": "Ensure that all S3 buckets associated with your AWS account are owned by your account. Be cautious of services that create buckets with predictable names. Whenever possible, pre-create these buckets in all regions to prevent hijacking.",
