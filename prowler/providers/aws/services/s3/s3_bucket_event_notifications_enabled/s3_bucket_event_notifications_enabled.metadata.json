  "Description": "**Amazon S3 buckets** define a **notification configuration** that publishes bucket events (for example `s3:ObjectCreated:*`, `s3:ObjectRemoved:*`) to a destination. The evaluation identifies buckets that lack any notification setup.",
  "Risk": "Missing notifications leaves object and bucket changes **unseen**, weakening **integrity** and **availability** oversight. Undetected deletions, policy drift, or replication issues can stall data pipelines (S3 to Lambda/SQS), slow incident response, and allow tampering or exfiltration to persist longer.",

Pair with object-level logging for **defense in depth**.",
