  "Description": "**Amazon Data Firehose** delivery streams must enable **server-side encryption at rest** with AWS KMS regardless of the source type. Encryption of upstream sources such as **Kinesis Data Streams** or **MSK** does not replace the need to protect the delivery stream itself.",
  "Risk": "Unencrypted Firehose data at rest can be read if storage or backups are accessed, harming **confidentiality** and **integrity**. Disk-level access, snapshots, or misconfigured destinations enable data exfiltration or tampering. Lacking KMS-backed controls also reduces key rotation, segregation of duties, and auditability.",

Ensure upstream **Kinesis** sources are encrypted and confirm MSK defaults meet policy. Monitor KMS health signals and deny writes without encryption. Apply **defense in depth** at destinations.",
