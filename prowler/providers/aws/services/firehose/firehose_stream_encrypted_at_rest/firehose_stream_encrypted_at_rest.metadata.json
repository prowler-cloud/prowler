  "Risk": "Without encryption at rest, data in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams is vulnerable to unauthorized access if the storage layer is compromised. This increases the risk of sensitive information exposure, potentially leading to data breaches or non-compliance with security regulations.",
