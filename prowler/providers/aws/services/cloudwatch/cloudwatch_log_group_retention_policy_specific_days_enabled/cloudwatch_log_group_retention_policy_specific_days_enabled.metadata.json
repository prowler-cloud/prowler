  "Description": "**CloudWatch Log Groups** are assessed for a retention period at or above the configured threshold (e.g., `365` days) or for being set to **never expire**. Log groups with shorter retention are identified.",
  "Risk": "Short log retention erodes audit evidence. Adversaries can wait out the window, creating gaps in detection, forensics, and compliance reporting. This degrades the **availability** of historical logs and the **integrity** of incident timelines.",
