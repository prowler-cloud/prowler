  "Description": "**CloudWatch Log Groups** with resource policies that grant access to any principal are identified. Statements using `Principal:\"*\"` or wildcard `Resource` that reference a log group ARN indicate that the log group is exposed through a public policy.",
  "Risk": "Public access to log groups enables unauthorized reading of logs, revealing secrets and operational metadata, harming **confidentiality**. If broad actions are allowed, attackers can modify subscriptions or logs, undermining **integrity** and disrupting **availability** of audit evidence.",

Grant only necessary actions, apply conditions to constrain use, and enforce **least privilege** and **separation of duties** with regular policy reviews.",
