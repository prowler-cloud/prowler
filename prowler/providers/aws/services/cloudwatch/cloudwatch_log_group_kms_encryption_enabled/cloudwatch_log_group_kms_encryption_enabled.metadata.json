  "Description": "**CloudWatch log groups** are assessed for **at-rest encryption** by checking if an **AWS KMS key** is associated with the log group via `kmsKeyId`.",
  "Risk": "Without a **customer-managed KMS key**, logs rely on service-managed encryption, limiting control and auditability.\n- Confidentiality: weaker key-policy barriers against unauthorized reads\n- Integrity/availability: no custom rotation or rapid revoke, hindering incident response and compliance",
