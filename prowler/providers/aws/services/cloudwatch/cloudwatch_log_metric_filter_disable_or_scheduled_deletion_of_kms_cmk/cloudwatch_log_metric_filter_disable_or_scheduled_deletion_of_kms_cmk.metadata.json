  "Description": "CloudTrail events delivered to CloudWatch are evaluated for a **metric filter and alarm** that monitor **KMS CMK state changes**, specifically `DisableKey` and `ScheduleKeyDeletion` from `kms.amazonaws.com`.",
  "Risk": "Missing alerts on **CMK disablement or scheduled deletion** undermines **availability** and **integrity**: encrypted data may become undecryptable, backups unusable, and recovery impossible. Attackers or insiders can change key states unnoticed, causing outages and irreversible data loss.",
