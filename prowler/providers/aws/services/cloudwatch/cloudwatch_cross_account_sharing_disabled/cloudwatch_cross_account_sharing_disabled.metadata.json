  "Description": "**Amazon CloudWatch** cross-account sharing via the `CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharingRole` allows other AWS accounts to view your metrics, dashboards, and alarms. The presence of this role indicates that sharing is active.",
  "Risk": "Granting other accounts visibility into observability data reduces **confidentiality** and enables **reconnaissance**. Adversaries or over-privileged partners can map architectures, profile workloads, and spot alerting gaps, increasing chances of **lateral movement** and **evasion**.",
