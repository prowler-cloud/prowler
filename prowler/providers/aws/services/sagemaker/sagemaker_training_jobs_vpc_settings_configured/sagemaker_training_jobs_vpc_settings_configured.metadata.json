  "Description": "**SageMaker training jobs** are evaluated for **VPC configuration** by detecting defined `subnets` in the job settings. With VPC settings, ENIs place the job in your VPC so traffic for training volumes and outputs uses private networking.",
  "Risk": "Without VPC settings, training containers rely on public networking and broad egress. This weakens **confidentiality** and **integrity**, enabling data exfiltration of datasets or model artifacts, malware downloads, and bypass of granular security group controls and VPC-based monitoring.",
