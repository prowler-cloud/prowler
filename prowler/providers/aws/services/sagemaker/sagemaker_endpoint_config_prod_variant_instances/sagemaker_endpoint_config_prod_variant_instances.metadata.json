  "Description": "This control checks whether production variants of an Amazon SageMaker endpoint have an initial instance count greater than 1. A single instance creates a single point of failure and reduces availability.",
  "Risk": "Having only one instance for a SageMaker endpoint production variant can lead to reduced availability, single points of failure, and slow recovery during incidents, especially if the instance becomes unavailable due to failure or security incidents.",
