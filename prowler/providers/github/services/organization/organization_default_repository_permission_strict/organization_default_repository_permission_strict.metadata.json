  "Description": "**GitHub organization** base repository permission for members uses a **strict setting** such as `read` or `none` rather than permissive options like `write` or `admin`. *Applies to members, not outside collaborators.*",
  "Risk": "**Excessive default permissions** (`write`/`admin`) erode code **integrity** and **availability**.\n\nAny member-or a compromised account-can alter many repos, inject malicious commits, change tags/releases, or delete branches, enabling supply-chain compromise and large-scale disruptions.",

      "Text": "Apply **least privilege**: set base permission to `none` or `read`.\n\nGrant higher access explicitly via teams per repo and enforce **separation of duties** with required reviews and **branch protection**. Regularly audit memberships and access to limit blast radius and maintain **defense in depth**.",
