  "Description": "**GitHub repositories** are assessed for **dependency vulnerability scanning** enabled via `Dependabot alerts`, which monitors the dependency graph for known vulnerable packages and versions.",
  "Risk": "Without automated scanning, known vulnerable dependencies may persist unnoticed, enabling supply-chain compromise. Exploits in third-party libraries can drive RCE, data theft, or build tampering, undermining confidentiality, integrity, and availability across code and CI/CD.",
