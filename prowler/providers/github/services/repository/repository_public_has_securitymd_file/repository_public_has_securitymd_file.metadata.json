  "Description": "**Public repositories** include a `SECURITY.md` policy file that tells researchers how to report vulnerabilities. The evaluation focuses on the presence of this file in public repositories.",
  "Risk": "Without **SECURITY.md**, reporters may use public issues or ad-hoc channels, causing premature disclosure or missed reports. This widens the exploit window and impacts **confidentiality** (leaked details), **integrity** (unauthorized changes), and **availability** (DoS from unpatched flaws).",
