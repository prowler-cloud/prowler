  "Description": "Teams Meetings global policy restricts **lobby bypass** so only `EveryoneInCompanyExcludingGuests`, `OrganizerOnly`, or `InvitedUsers` are auto-admitted; all others wait in the lobby.",
  "Risk": "Auto-admitting external or anonymous users undermines **confidentiality** via covert listening and access to chat/files, and **integrity** through meeting hijacks, malicious screen sharing, and phishing. It also impacts **availability** by enabling disruptions and unsanctioned sessions.",
