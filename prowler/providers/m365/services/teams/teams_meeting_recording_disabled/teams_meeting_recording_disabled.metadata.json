  "Description": "Microsoft Teams Global meeting policy has **cloud meeting recording** disabled by default (`AllowCloudRecording=false`).",
  "Risk": "Recording allowed by default enables uncontrolled capture of meetings, threatening **confidentiality**. Files and transcripts persist in collaboration stores and can be broadly shared, leading to insider exfiltration, accidental leakage, and long-lived exposure of sensitive discussions.",
