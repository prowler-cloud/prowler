  "Description": "Microsoft Teams tenant configuration for **channel email addresses** determines if channels can receive messages via email. This evaluates the `allow_email_into_channel` setting.",
  "Risk": "Allowing email into channels lets outsiders inject content, links, and attachments into Teams. Leaked addresses enable **phishing**, **malware delivery**, and spam, undermining **confidentiality** and **integrity**, and adding noise that affects **availability**; posts may bypass user-authenticated context.",
