  "Description": "**Seamless Single Sign-On (SSO)** in hybrid Microsoft Entra deployments allows automatic authentication for domain-joined devices on the corporate network.\n\nThis check verifies the actual Seamless SSO configuration in directory synchronization settings. Modern devices with **Primary Refresh Token** (PRT) support no longer require Seamless SSO.",
  "Risk": "Seamless SSO can be exploited for **lateral movement** between on-premises domains and Entra ID when an Entra Connect server is compromised. It can also be used to perform **brute force attacks** against Entra ID, as authentication through the AZUREADSSOACC account bypasses standard protections.",
