  "Description": "**Microsoft Entra groups** are evaluated for **dynamic membership** that includes only users with `userType -eq \"Guest\"`.\n\nThe finding indicates whether a guest-targeted dynamic group exists to centrally scope policies and governance.",
  "Risk": "Without a dedicated dynamic guest group, guests may evade consistent **Conditional Access** and least-privilege controls. This threatens **confidentiality** via excess data access, weakens **integrity** through unauthorized changes, and leaves stale external accounts that enable lateral movement.",
