  "Severity": "high",
  "ResourceType": "",
  "Description": "Conditional Access for administrator roles requires **phishing-resistant MFA** authentication strength on `All` applications. Disabled policies are ignored; report-only policies aren't considered. Policies with custom strengths require review to confirm they are truly **phishing-resistant**.",
  "Risk": "Without phishing-resistant MFA on admin accounts, attackers can:\n- Bypass OTP/push via **AiTM phishing**\n- Abuse **MFA fatigue** to gain sessions\n- Perform **tenant takeover**, alter policies, and exfiltrate data\n\nThis harms confidentiality, configuration integrity, and service availability.",
