  "Description": "**Microsoft 365 calendar sharing** is evaluated at the organization level to determine if sharing with external recipients is disabled, including blocking anonymous access and links sent outside the tenant.",
  "Risk": "Allowing **external calendar sharing** exposes meeting metadata (subjects, locations, attendees, patterns), weakening confidentiality. Adversaries can profile staff, craft convincing spear-phish or fake invites, time fraud attempts, and stage meeting hijacks, increasing **BEC** and social engineering success.",
