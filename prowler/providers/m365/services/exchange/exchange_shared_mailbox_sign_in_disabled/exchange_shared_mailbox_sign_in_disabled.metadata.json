  "Description": "Shared mailboxes are used for collaboration and should not permit direct sign-in. This check verifies that the **AccountEnabled** property is set to `false` in Entra ID for all shared mailboxes, preventing direct authentication.",
  "Risk": "When sign-in is enabled on shared mailboxes, users with the password can bypass delegation controls and access the mailbox directly. This undermines **accountability** since actions cannot be attributed to individual users, and it increases the attack surface for credential-based attacks.",
