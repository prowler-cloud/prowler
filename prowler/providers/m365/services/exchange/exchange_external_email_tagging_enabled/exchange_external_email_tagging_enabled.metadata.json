  "Severity": "medium",

  "Description": "**Exchange Online** uses native external sender identification so supported Outlook clients display an `External` tag on messages originating outside the organization.",
  "Risk": "Without the native tag, users lose a clear signal that a message is from outside the tenant, increasing susceptibility to **phishing**, **BEC**, and credential theft. This raises risks to **confidentiality** (exfiltration) and **integrity** (fraudulent approvals) via social engineering and reply-chain attacks.",
