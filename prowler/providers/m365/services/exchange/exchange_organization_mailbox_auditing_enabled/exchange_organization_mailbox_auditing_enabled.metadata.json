  "Description": "Exchange Online organization setting `AuditDisabled` controls tenant-wide **mailbox auditing**. This evaluates whether it is `False` so default audit events are recorded for owner, delegate, and admin across all mailboxes, taking precedence over per-mailbox settings.",
  "Risk": "Disabling tenant-wide auditing lets mailbox activity go unrecorded. Adversaries or insiders could exfiltrate data, alter or delete messages, or send as users without trace, undermining **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and effective **incident response**.",
