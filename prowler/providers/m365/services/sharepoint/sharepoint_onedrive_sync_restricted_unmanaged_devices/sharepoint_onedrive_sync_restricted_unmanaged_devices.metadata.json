  "Description": "SharePoint tenant settings for **OneDrive sync** enforce that only **managed, domain-joined devices** can sync. The evaluation looks for a configured list of approved `domain GUIDs` that limits syncing to specific Active Directory domains.",
  "Risk": "Without this restriction, users can sync SharePoint/OneDrive files to **unmanaged devices**, undermining:\n- **Confidentiality**: data copied to personal or lost endpoints, outside DLP.\n- **Integrity**: malicious edits synced back to sites.\n- **Availability**: mass deletion or ransomware can propagate via sync clients.",
