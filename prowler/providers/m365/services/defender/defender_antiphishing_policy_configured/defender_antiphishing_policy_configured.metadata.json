  "Description": "**Microsoft Defender for Office 365 anti-phishing policies** are evaluated for custom scoping to users, groups, or domains and precedence over the default, plus key settings: **spoof intelligence**, DMARC honoring, `quarantine` actions for spoof/DMARC, **safety tips**, unauthenticated sender indicators, and policy enablement.",
  "Risk": "Missing or lax configuration lets **spoofed** and **impersonated** emails reach inboxes. Ignoring DMARC or not using `quarantine` enables delivery of fraudulent messages, driving **credential theft**, **BEC**, and **account takeover**, compromising data **confidentiality** and **integrity** and enabling lateral movement via mailbox rule abuse.",
