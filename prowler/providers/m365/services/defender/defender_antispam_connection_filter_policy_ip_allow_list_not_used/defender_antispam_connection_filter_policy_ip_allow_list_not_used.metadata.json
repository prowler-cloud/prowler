  "Description": "This check focuses on Microsoft 365 organizations with Exchange Online mailboxes or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations. It ensures that the connection filter policy's IP Allow List is empty or undefined to prevent bypassing spam filtering and sender authentication checks, which could lead to successful delivery of malicious emails.",
  "Risk": "Using the IP Allow List without additional verification like mail flow rules poses a risk, as emails from these sources skip essential security checks (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). This could allow attackers to deliver harmful emails directly to the Inbox.",

  "Remediation": {

      "Other": "1. Navigate to Microsoft 365 Defender https://security.microsoft.com. 2. Click to expand Email & collaboration and select Policies & rules. 3. On the Policies & rules page select Threat policies. 4. Under Policies, select Anti-spam and click on the Connection filter policy (Default). 5. Remove IP entries from the allow list. 6. Click Save.",
