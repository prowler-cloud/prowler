  "Description": "This check ensures that DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is enabled for all Exchange Online domains. DKIM is a crucial authentication method that, along with SPF and DMARC, helps prevent attackers from sending spoofed emails that appear to originate from your domain. By adding a digital signature to outbound emails, DKIM allows receiving email systems to verify the legitimacy of incoming messages.",
  "Risk": "If DKIM is not enabled, attackers may send spoofed emails that appear to originate from your domain, potentially leading to phishing attacks and damage to your domain's reputation.",
