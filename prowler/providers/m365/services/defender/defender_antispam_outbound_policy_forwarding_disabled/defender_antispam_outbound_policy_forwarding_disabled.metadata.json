  "Description": "**Defender outbound spam policies** are evaluated to confirm that automatic mail forwarding is disabled in the default policy and in any custom policies applied to users, groups, or domains.",
  "Risk": "Allowing **automatic forwarding** enables covert **data exfiltration**, eroding **confidentiality**. Attackers or insiders can auto-route mail to external inboxes, persist access, evade monitoring, and harvest sensitive content (tickets, approvals, MFA codes), enabling **lateral movement** and fraud while reducing auditability.",
