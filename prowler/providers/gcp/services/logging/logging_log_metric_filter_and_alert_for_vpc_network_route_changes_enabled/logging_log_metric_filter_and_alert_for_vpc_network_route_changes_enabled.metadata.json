  "Description": "**Cloud Logging** includes a **log-based metric** for **VPC route modifications** and a linked **Cloud Monitoring alert**.\n\nIt targets `gce_route` entries for `compute.routes.insert` and `compute.routes.delete` so route creations or deletions generate alertable signals.",
  "Risk": "Without visibility into **route changes**, attackers or mistakes can:\n- Reroute traffic to bypass inspection  **data exfiltration** (confidentiality)\n- Alter paths enabling **lateral movement** (integrity)\n- Blackhole networks causing **outages** (availability)",
