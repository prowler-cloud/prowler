  "Description": "Cloud Logging contains a **log-based metric** targeting project ownership changes in Cloud Resource Manager events, and Cloud Monitoring has an **alerting policy** tied to that metric. It detects metrics matching `roles/owner` additions/removals or ownership invites, and whether an alert references that metric.",
  "Risk": "Lack of alerts on ownership changes enables **privilege escalation** and **project takeover**. Attackers can add/remove `roles/owner`, causing unauthorized data access (confidentiality), unauthorized config/billing changes (integrity), and resource deletion or lockout (availability) without timely detection.",

      "Text": "Create a log-based metric for ownership assignment/removal events and link it to an alerting policy that notifies a monitored channel. Minimize use of `roles/owner` per **least privilege**, require approvals and separation of duties, and apply **defense in depth** with centralized monitoring of IAM changes across projects.",
