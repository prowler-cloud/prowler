  "Description": "Enabling retention policies on log buckets will protect logs stored in cloud storage buckets from being overwritten or accidentally deleted.",
  "Risk": "Sinks can be configured to export logs in storage buckets. It is recommended to configure a data retention policy for these cloud storage buckets and to lock the data retention policy; thus permanently preventing the policy from being reduced or removed. This way, if the system is ever compromised by an attacker or a malicious insider who wants to cover their tracks, the activity logs are definitely preserved for forensics and security investigations.",
