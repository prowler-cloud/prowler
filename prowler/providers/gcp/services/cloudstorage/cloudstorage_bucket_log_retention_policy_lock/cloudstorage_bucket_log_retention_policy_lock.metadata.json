  "Description": "Enabling retention policies on log buckets will protect logs stored in cloud storage buckets from being overwritten or accidentally deleted.",
  "Risk": "Sinks can be configured to export logs in storage buckets. It is recommended to configure a data retention policy for these cloud storage buckets and to lock the data retention policy, thus permanently preventing the policy from being reduced or removed. This way, if the system is ever compromised by an attacker or a malicious insider who wants to cover their tracks, the activity logs are definitely preserved for forensics and security investigations.",
