  "Description": "**Cloud Storage log sink buckets** have a configured **retention period** with **Bucket Lock** applied, ensuring the retention policy cannot be shortened or removed.",
  "Risk": "Without a locked retention policy, exported logs can be deleted early or retention reduced, undermining log **integrity** and **availability**. An attacker or malicious insider could purge evidence to evade detection, hindering **forensics** and weakening **non-repudiation** across the environment.",
