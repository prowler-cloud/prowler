  "Description": "**Google Cloud Storage buckets** are assessed for **Soft Delete** being enabled with a non-zero retention window, meaning deleted objects are temporarily preserved and can be restored until the window expires.",
  "Risk": "**No Soft Delete** makes object deletions **immediate and irreversible**, undermining data **availability** and **integrity**. Accidental removal, compromised credentials, wiper malware, or misconfigured lifecycle rules can erase datasets with no recovery path, breaking RPO/RTO and legal retention expectations.",

Apply **least privilege** for delete/undelete actions and use **defense in depth** with object versioning and retention policies. Monitor deletion events and regularly test restore procedures to ensure recoverability.",
