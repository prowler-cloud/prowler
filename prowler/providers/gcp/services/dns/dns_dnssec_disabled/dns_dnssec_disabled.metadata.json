  "Description": "**Cloud DNS managed zones** are assessed for **DNSSEC** status. Zones with DNSSEC sign zone data and publish `DNSKEY`/`RRSIG`; zones without it remain unsigned and unauthenticated.",
  "Risk": "Without **DNSSEC**, DNS responses lack authenticity, enabling cache poisoning, spoofed referrals, and domain hijacking. Victims may be redirected to attacker hosts, exposing credentials and data (confidentiality), enabling tampered content and records (integrity), and causing misrouting or outages (availability).",
