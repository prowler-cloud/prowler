  "Description": "Ensure that VPC Flow Logs is enabled for every subnet created within your production Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network. Flow Logs is a logging feature that enables users to capture information about the IP traffic (accepted, rejected, or all traffic) going to and from the network interfaces (ENIs) available within your VPC subnets.",
  "Risk": "By default, the VPC Flow Logs feature is disabled when a new VPC network subnet is created. Once enabled, VPC Flow Logs will start collecting network traffic data to and from your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) subnets, logging data that can be useful for understanding network usage, network traffic expense optimization, network forensics, and real-time security analysis. To enhance Google Cloud VPC network visibility and security it is strongly recommended to enable Flow Logs for every business-critical or production VPC subnet.",
