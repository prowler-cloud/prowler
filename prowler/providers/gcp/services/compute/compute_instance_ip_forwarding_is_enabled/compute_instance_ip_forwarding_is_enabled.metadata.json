  "Description": "**Compute Engine VM instances** with `canIpForward` enabled are identified. This setting allows a VM to process packets not addressed to its own IP.\n\nInstances created by GKE (`gke-` prefix) are excluded from this evaluation.",
  "Risk": "With **IP forwarding** a VM can route traffic for other addresses. If compromised, it can:\n- Spoof or tamper flows (**integrity**)\n- Intercept/redirect internal traffic (**confidentiality**)\n- Mask egress for exfiltration and enable lateral movement, degrading **availability**",
