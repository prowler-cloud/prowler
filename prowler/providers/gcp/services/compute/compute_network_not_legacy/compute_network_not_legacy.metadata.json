  "Description": "**Google Cloud networks** are evaluated for **legacy mode** (`subnet_mode: legacy`). The finding highlights networks using the older, non-subnetted design instead of **VPC with regional subnets**.",
  "Risk": "Legacy networks lack subnets, peering, and private access. This reduces isolation and forces public IP paths, weakening **confidentiality** and enabling lateral movement/data exfiltration. Coarse controls and routing limits threaten **integrity**. A single global range and gateway create contention that can degrade **availability**.",

Apply **least privilege** segmentation, enable private access and **Cloud NAT** to avoid public exposure, and use peering or private connectivity for dependencies. *Plan and test migration to limit downtime*.",
