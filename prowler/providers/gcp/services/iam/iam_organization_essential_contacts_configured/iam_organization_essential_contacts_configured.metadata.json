By default, these types of notifications are sent to members with certain Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles such as 'roles/owner' and 'roles/billing.admin'. With Essential Contacts, you can specify exactly who receives important notifications by providing your own list of contacts (i.e. email addresses).",
