  "Description": "**IAM service accounts** do not have keys of type `USER_MANAGED`; only Google-managed keys (or no keys) are present.",
  "Risk": "**User-managed keys** are downloadable and long-lived, increasing theft and reuse risk. An attacker with a key can impersonate the service account, perform unauthorized API calls, exfiltrate data, and alter resources, impacting **confidentiality** and **integrity**, and potentially **availability**. Copies in repos or logs can evade centralized rotation and revocation.",

Enforce `iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation`, restrict who can create keys, and monitor usage. *If exceptions are unavoidable*, tightly scope, rotate aggressively, and store keys securely.",
