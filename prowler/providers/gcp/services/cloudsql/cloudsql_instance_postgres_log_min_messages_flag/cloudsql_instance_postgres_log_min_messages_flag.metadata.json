  "Risk": "Auditing helps in troubleshooting operational problems and also permits forensic analysis. If log_min_messages is not set to the correct value, messages may not be classified as error messages appropriately.

ERROR is considered the best practice setting. Changes should only be made in accordance with the organization's logging policy.",
