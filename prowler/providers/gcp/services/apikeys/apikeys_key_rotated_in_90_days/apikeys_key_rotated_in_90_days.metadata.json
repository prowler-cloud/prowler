      "Text": "Ensure that all your Google Cloud API keys are regularly regenerated (rotated) in order to meet security and compliance requirements. By default, it is recommended to rotate keys every 90 days. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) API keys are simple, encrypted strings that can be used when calling specific APIs that don't need to access private user data. API keys are typically used to track API requests associated with your GCP project for quota and billing. Rotating GCP API keys will substantially reduce the window of opportunity for exploits and ensure that data can't be accessed with an outdated key that might have been lost, cracked, or stolen.",
