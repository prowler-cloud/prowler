  "Description": "Google Cloud projects are evaluated for **active API keys**. The finding indicates whether any keys exist and are enabled in the project, regardless of restrictions or usage.",
  "Risk": "Active API keys are **bearer tokens** often exposed in clients and lack **user identity**. Compromise enables unauthorized API calls causing data exposure (C), unauthorized changes (I), quota/service exhaustion (A), and **billing abuse**. Keys can be harvested from code, logs, or intercepted requests.",
