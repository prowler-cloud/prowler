    Check if Microsoft 365 SharePoint restricts external sharing at organization level.

    This check verifies that external sharing settings in SharePoint are configured to allow only "New and existing guests"

    setting is used, legacy sharing may be allowed, increasing the risk of unauthorized data access.
