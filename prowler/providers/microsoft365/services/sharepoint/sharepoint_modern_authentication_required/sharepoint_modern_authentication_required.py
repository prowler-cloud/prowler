    Check if Microsoft 365 SharePoint requires modern authentication.

    This check verifies that modern authentication is enforced for SharePoint applications in Microsoft 365.
    Modern authentication leverages OAuth 2.0 and supports advanced security features such as multi-factor
    authentication (MFA) and conditional access. Legacy authentication protocols (e.g., basic authentication)
    do not support these features and increase the risk of credential compromise.

    The check fails if modern authentication is not enforced, indicating that legacy protocols may be used.
