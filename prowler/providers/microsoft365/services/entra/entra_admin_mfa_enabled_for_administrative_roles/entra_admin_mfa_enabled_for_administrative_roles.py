    Ensure multifactor authentication is enabled for all users in administrative roles.

    This check verifies that at least one Conditional Access Policy in Microsoft Entra, which is in an enabled state,
    applies to administrative roles and enforces multifactor authentication (MFA). Enforcing MFA for privileged accounts
    is critical to reduce the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials.

    The check fails if no enabled policy is found that requires MFA for any administrative role.
