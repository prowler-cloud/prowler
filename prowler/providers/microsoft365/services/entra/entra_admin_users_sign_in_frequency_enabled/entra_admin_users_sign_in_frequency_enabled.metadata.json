  "Description": "Ensure Sign-in frequency periodic reauthentication is enabled and properly configured to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and session hijacking.",
  "Risk": "Allowing persistent browser sessions and long sign-in frequencies for administrative users increases the risk of unauthorized access. Attackers could exploit session persistence to maintain access to an admin account without reauthentication, increasing the likelihood of account compromise, especially in cases of credential theft or session hijacking.",

Under Users include, select users and groups and check Directory roles. At a minimum, include the directory roles listed below in this section of the document. Under Target resources, include All cloud apps and do not create any exclusions. Under Grant, select Grant Access and check Require multifactor authentication. Under Session, select Sign-in frequency, select Periodic reauthentication, and set it to 4 hours for E3 tenants. E5 tenants with PIM can be set to a maximum value of 24 hours. Check Persistent browser session, then select Never persistent in the drop-down menu. 4. Under Enable policy, set it to Report Only until the organization is ready to enable it.",

      "Text": "Enforce a sign-in frequency limit of no more than 4 hours for E3 tenants (or 24 hours for E5 with Privileged Identity Management) and set browser sessions to Never persistent. This ensures that administrative users are regularly reauthenticated, reducing the risk of prolonged unauthorized access and mitigating session hijacking threats.",
