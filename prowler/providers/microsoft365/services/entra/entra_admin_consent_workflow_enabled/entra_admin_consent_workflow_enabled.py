    Ensure the admin consent workflow is enabled in Microsoft Entra.

    This check verifies that the admin consent workflow is enabled in Microsoft Entra to allow users
    to request admin approval for applications requiring consent. Enabling the admin consent workflow
    ensures that applications which require additional permissions are only granted access after an
    administratorâ€™s approval, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and work disruptions.

    The check fails if the admin consent workflow is not enabled, indicating that users might be blocked
    from accessing critical applications or forced to use insecure workarounds.
