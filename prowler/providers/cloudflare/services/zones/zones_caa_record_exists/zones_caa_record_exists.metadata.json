  "Description": "**Cloudflare zones** are assessed for **CAA (Certificate Authority Authorization)** DNS records by checking if they exist to specify which **certificate authorities** are permitted to issue SSL/TLS certificates for the domain.",
  "Risk": "Without **CAA** records, any certificate authority can issue certificates for your domain.\n- **Confidentiality**: unauthorized certificates enable man-in-the-middle attacks\n- **Integrity**: attackers can impersonate your domain with fraudulently obtained certificates\n- **Trust**: CA compromise or social engineering can result in unauthorized certificate issuance",
