  "Risk": "Without **includeSubDomains**, subdomains remain vulnerable even when the main domain has HSTS enabled.\n- **Confidentiality**: attackers can intercept traffic on unprotected subdomains\n- **Integrity**: SSL stripping attacks can downgrade subdomain connections to HTTP\n- **Trust**: inconsistent security policy across the domain hierarchy",
