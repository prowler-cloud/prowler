  "Risk": "With **Development Mode** enabled, Cloudflare bypasses caching and some optimizations.\n- **Confidentiality**: some security features may be affected or bypassed\n- **Integrity**: performance optimizations are disabled impacting site reliability\n- **Availability**: origin server is exposed to increased load without caching protection",
