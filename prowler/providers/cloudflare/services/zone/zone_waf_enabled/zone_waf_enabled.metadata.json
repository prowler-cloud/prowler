  "Description": "**Cloudflare zones** are assessed for **Cloudflare Managed Ruleset** deployment. This managed ruleset (available on Pro, Business and Enterprise plans) provides fast and effective protection against common web vulnerabilities including **SQL injection**, **XSS**, and other threats. The Free Managed Ruleset (always active) is excluded. OWASP Core Ruleset coverage is handled by a separate check (`zone_waf_owasp_ruleset_enabled`).",
  "Risk": "Without **WAF**, web applications are exposed to common attack vectors.\n- **Confidentiality**: SQL injection attacks can exfiltrate sensitive database contents\n- **Integrity**: XSS attacks can modify page content and steal session tokens\n- **Availability**: application-layer attacks can cause service disruption",
