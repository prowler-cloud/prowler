  "Risk": "Without **Universal SSL**, visitors cannot establish HTTPS connections to your site.\n- **Confidentiality**: all traffic is unencrypted and vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping\n- **Integrity**: HTTP responses can be modified in transit by attackers (content injection, malware)\n- **Trust**: browsers display security warnings degrading user trust and experience",
