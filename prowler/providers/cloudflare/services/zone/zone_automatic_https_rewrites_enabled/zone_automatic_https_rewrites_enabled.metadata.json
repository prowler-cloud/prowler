  "Description": "**Cloudflare zones** are assessed for **Automatic HTTPS Rewrites** configuration by checking if it is enabled to automatically rewrite insecure HTTP links to HTTPS, resolving **mixed content issues** and enhancing site security.",
  "Risk": "Without **Automatic HTTPS Rewrites**, pages may contain mixed content where HTTP resources load over HTTPS pages.\n- **Confidentiality**: insecure resources can be intercepted and modified by attackers\n- **Integrity**: browsers block or warn about mixed content, indicating potential tampering\n- **User Experience**: security warnings degrade trust and some browsers block mixed content entirely",
