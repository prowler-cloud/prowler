  "Risk": "Without **strict SSL mode**, traffic between Cloudflare and origin may use unvalidated or unencrypted connections.\n- **Confidentiality**: sensitive data can be intercepted in transit via man-in-the-middle attacks\n- **Integrity**: responses can be modified without detection between Cloudflare and origin\n- **Compliance**: may violate PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and other regulatory requirements for encrypted transport",
