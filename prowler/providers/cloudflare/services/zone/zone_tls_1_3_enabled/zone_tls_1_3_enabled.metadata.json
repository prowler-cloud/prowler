  "Description": "**Cloudflare zones** are assessed for **TLS 1.3** configuration by checking if it is enabled to benefit from **improved security** through simplified cipher suites and **faster handshakes** with zero round-trip time resumption.",
  "Risk": "Without **TLS 1.3**, connections use older TLS versions with less secure characteristics.\n- **Confidentiality**: legacy TLS versions have more complex cipher negotiations that may expose weaknesses\n- **Integrity**: older protocols lack protection against downgrade attacks that TLS 1.3 provides\n- **Performance**: slower handshakes impact user experience and increase latency",
