  "Description": "**Cloudflare zones** are assessed for **Always Online** configuration by checking if it is disabled to prevent serving **stale cached content** when the origin server is unavailable, which could expose outdated or sensitive information.",
  "Risk": "With **Always Online** enabled, Cloudflare serves cached pages when the origin is unavailable.\n- **Confidentiality**: stale cache may expose sensitive information that was subsequently removed\n- **Integrity**: outdated content may contain incorrect or superseded information\n- **Availability**: reliance on cached content masks origin failures requiring attention",

    "Recommendation": {
      "Text": "Disable **Always Online** and implement proper high availability solutions.\n- Use redundant origins or load balancing for genuine high availability\n- Stale cached content may contain outdated security information\n- Origin failures should be detected and addressed, not masked\n- Consider Cloudflare Workers for custom failover logic if needed",
