  "Description": "**Cloudflare DNS records** are assessed for **wildcard usage** by checking if A, AAAA, or CNAME records use wildcard entries (*.example.com) which can **increase attack surface** and expose unintended services.",
  "Risk": "**Wildcard DNS records** can expose unintended services and increase attack surface.\n- **Confidentiality**: any subdomain resolves, potentially exposing internal naming conventions\n- **Integrity**: attackers can access unintended services via arbitrary subdomains\n- **Availability**: wildcard records may route traffic to services not designed for public access",
