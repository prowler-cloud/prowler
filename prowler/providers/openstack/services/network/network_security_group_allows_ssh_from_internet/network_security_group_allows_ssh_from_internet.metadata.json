  "Description": "**OpenStack security groups** are evaluated to verify that SSH (port 22) is **not exposed to the Internet** (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0). Security groups act as virtual firewalls controlling network traffic to instances. Unrestricted SSH access violates the principle of least privilege and creates a significant attack surface. Best practices recommend restricting SSH access to **known IP ranges**, **bastion hosts**, or **VPN gateways** instead of allowing access from any Internet address.",
  "Risk": "Security groups allowing SSH from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 expose instances to continuous brute-force attacks from automated scanners and botnets. Attackers can enumerate usernames, test weak passwords, and exploit SSH vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-38408, CVE-2021-41617) to gain initial access. Once compromised, attackers can establish persistence with backdoors, escalate privileges, steal credentials from memory, and pivot laterally to other instances. Exposed SSH ports are constantly targeted by Internet-wide scanning tools (Shodan, Censys) and credential stuffing campaigns. Compromised instances become launchpads for crypto mining, DDoS botnets, data exfiltration, and ransomware deployment. SSH exposure bypasses defense-in-depth controls and enables direct access to production workloads without additional authentication layers.",

      "Text": "Restrict SSH access to known IP ranges using bastion hosts or VPN gateways instead of allowing 0.0.0.0/0. Implement multi-factor authentication, disable password authentication, and use SSH certificates for centralized key management. Monitor SSH logs for failed login attempts and enforce fail2ban or similar IP blocking mechanisms.",

  "Notes": "This check flags security groups with SSH (port 22) ingress rules allowing 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0. Some architectures legitimately require public SSH access (bastion hosts, CI/CD runners with dynamic IPs). Review findings in context of your security architecture. Rules allowing SSH from specific IPs (e.g., 203.0.113.0/24) or from other security groups (remote_group_id) are not flagged. IPv6 rules (::/0) are also checked. Port ranges that include port 22 (e.g., 20-25) will trigger this check."
