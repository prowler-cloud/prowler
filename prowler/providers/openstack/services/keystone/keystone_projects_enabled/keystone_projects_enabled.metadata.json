  "Description": "**Keystone projects** are evaluated to ensure they remain **enabled**. Projects serve as resource containers and authorization scopes; they must stay enabled for assigned **tenants** and **services** to authenticate, obtain tokens, and isolate workloads.",
  "Risk": "Disabling a project immediately blocks all assigned users and service accounts from obtaining authentication tokens. This disrupts:\n- **Availability**: workloads lose access to OpenStack APIs, halting operations\n- **Integrity**: configuration changes and automation pipelines fail\n- **Confidentiality**: valid users cannot access their own resources\nIt can trigger cascading failures across dependent services and violate SLAs.",

Execute `openstack project set --enable <project_id>`\n5. Verify with `openstack project show <project_id>` (check `enabled: True`)\n6. Test authentication for users assigned to this project",

    "Recommendation": {
      "Text": "Maintain a **project lifecycle policy**:\n- Keep production projects **enabled** at all times\n- Use **tags** or **metadata** to track project status (active, deprecated, staging)\n- Disable projects only during **decommissioning** with stakeholder approval\n- Implement **monitoring** to alert on unexpected project state changes\n- Document which services and users depend on each project\n- Require **MFA** and approvals before disabling critical projects",
