  "Description": "Security groups should not allow unrestricted access to all ports and protocols from the public internet (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0). Allowing all traffic creates a security risk by exposing all services running on the instances to potential attacks.",
  "Risk": "Allowing unrestricted access to all traffic from the internet exposes all services and applications to potential attacks, unauthorized access, and security breaches. This effectively bypasses the security group's purpose as a firewall.",
