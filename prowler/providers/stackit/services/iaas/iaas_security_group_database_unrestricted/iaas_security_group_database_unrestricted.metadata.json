  "Description": "Security groups should not allow unrestricted access to database ports from the public internet (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0). This includes MySQL (3306), PostgreSQL (5432), MongoDB (27017), Redis (6379), SQL Server (1433), and CouchDB (5984). Unrestricted database access can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access.",
  "Risk": "Allowing unrestricted database access from the internet exposes sensitive data to potential breaches, unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and malicious attacks. Databases often contain critical business data and should never be directly accessible from the public internet.",
