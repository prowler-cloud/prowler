  "Description": "Security groups should not allow unrestricted RDP access (port 3389) from the public internet (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0). Unrestricted RDP access increases the attack surface and can lead to unauthorized access, brute force attacks, and potential system compromise.",
  "Risk": "Allowing unrestricted RDP access from the internet exposes Windows servers to potential unauthorized access attempts, brute force attacks, ransomware, and security breaches. Attackers can exploit weak credentials or vulnerabilities.",
