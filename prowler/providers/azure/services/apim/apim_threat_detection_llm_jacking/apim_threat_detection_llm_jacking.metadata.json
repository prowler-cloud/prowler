  "Description": "This check analyzes Azure API Management diagnostic logs in Log Analytics to detect potential LLM Jacking attacks by monitoring the frequency of LLM-related operations (ImageGenerations_Create, ChatCompletions_Create, Completions_Create) from individual IP addresses within a configurable time window.",
  "Risk": "LLM Jacking attacks can lead to unauthorized access to AI models, potential data exfiltration, increased costs, and abuse of AI services. Attackers may use these endpoints to generate content, bypass rate limits, or access premium AI capabilities without proper authorization.",

    "Recommendation": {
      "Text": "To protect against LLM Jacking attacks: 1. Enable diagnostic logging for APIM instances and send logs to Log Analytics workspace 2. Configure appropriate thresholds for LLM operation frequency monitoring 3. Set up alerts for suspicious activity patterns 4. Implement rate limiting and IP allowlisting for sensitive AI endpoints 5. Regularly review and analyze APIM access logs for anomalies",
