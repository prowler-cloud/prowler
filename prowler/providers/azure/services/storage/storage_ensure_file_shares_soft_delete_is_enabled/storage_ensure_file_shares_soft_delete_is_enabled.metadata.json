  "Description": "**Azure Storage file shares** have **soft delete** with a retention period (`days`). The evaluation determines if the storage account's file service has this setting enabled and records the retention duration applied to all shares.",
  "Risk": "Without **soft delete**, deletions are irreversible, reducing **availability** and **integrity**. Mistakes or insiders can wipe shares, causing outages, data loss, and lengthy restores. Destructive deletes can magnify ransomware impact and block timely recovery.",
