  "Risk": "Without this exception, platform services relying on the account (backup, monitoring, replication) can be blocked, causing failed backups, missing logs, and stalled workflows-affecting **availability** and **integrity**. Teams may over-broaden network access to compensate, increasing **confidentiality** risk.",
