Images in registries are evaluated for known package vulnerabilities in their packages and dependencies.",
  "Risk": "Without registry scanning, **known CVEs** in images can reach runtime, enabling **RCE**, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. This undermines data confidentiality and integrity and can reduce availability through cryptomining or service disruption.",
