  "Description": "Require administrators or appropriately delegated users to register third-party applications.",
  "Risk": "It is recommended to only allow an administrator to register custom-developed applications. This ensures that the application undergoes a formal security review and approval process prior to exposing Azure Active Directory data. Certain users like developers or other high-request users may also be delegated permissions to prevent them from waiting on an administrative user. Your organization should review your policies and decide your needs.",
