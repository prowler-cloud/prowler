  "Description": "Microsoft Entra authorization settings are evaluated to determine if the default user role permits **user consent to applications**. The check looks at permission grant policies to see whether end users can authorize apps to access organization data on their behalf, or if consent is restricted (e.g., `Do not allow user consent`).",
  "Risk": "Permitting end-user consent enables **consent phishing** and over-privileged OAuth grants. Attackers can obtain tokens to read/send mail, access files, or act as the user, causing **data exfiltration**, persistence beyond password resets/MFA changes, and abuse of connected apps, impacting confidentiality and integrity.",
