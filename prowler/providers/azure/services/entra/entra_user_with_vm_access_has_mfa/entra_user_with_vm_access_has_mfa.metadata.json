  "Description": "Microsoft Entra users with Azure roles that grant VM sign-in or management access-such as `Owner`, `Contributor`, `Virtual Machine * Login`, and `Virtual Machine Contributor`-are evaluated for **multi-factor authentication** enrollment. The finding highlights accounts with VM access that lack more than one authentication factor.",
  "Risk": "Without **MFA**, accounts with VM access are vulnerable to phishing, password spraying, and credential stuffing. Compromise can enable remote VM login, abuse of the VM's managed identity, privilege escalation, and lateral movement-impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of workloads.",

Ensure that identities that are provisioned to a virtual machine utilizes an RBAC/ABAC group and is allocated a role using Azure PIM, and the Role settings require MFA or use another PAM solution (like CyberArk) for accessing Virtual Machines."
