  "Description": "**Microsoft Entra** directory setting **Group.Unified** governs who can create **Microsoft 365 Groups**. The evaluation inspects `EnableGroupCreation` and, when present, `GroupCreationAllowedGroupId` to determine if group creation is broadly allowed or restricted to a designated group.",
  "Risk": "Unrestricted group creation drives sprawl of Teams, SharePoint sites, and mailboxes, undermining **confidentiality** via public spaces and guest invites. Compromised accounts can create groups to stage exfiltration or impersonation. It also heightens **integrity** risks from unsanctioned owners and **operational** burden for lifecycle and governance.",
