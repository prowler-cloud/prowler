  "Description": "**Attached Azure managed disks** (OS and data) are assessed to confirm encryption uses **customer-managed keys** (`CMK`) via disk encryption sets rather than platform-managed keys. Scope includes disks currently attached to VMs, evaluating their encryption type to verify CMK is applied.",
  "Risk": "Without **CMK**, you lose control over key lifecycle and access. This weakens confidentiality and compliance: you can't enforce independent rotation, promptly revoke keys to crypto-lock stolen copies/snapshots, or separate duties. Misuse or compromise may keep data readable beyond your trust boundary.",
