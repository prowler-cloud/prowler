  "Notes": "The impact of configuring NSG Flow logs is primarily one of cost and configuration. If deployed, it will create storage accounts that hold minimal amounts of data on a 5-day lifecycle before feeding to Log Analytics Workspace. This will increase the amount of data stored and used by Azure Monitor."
