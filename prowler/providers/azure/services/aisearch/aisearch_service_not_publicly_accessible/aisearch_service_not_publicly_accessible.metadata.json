      "Text": "Ensure that the necessary virtual network configurations or IP rules are in place to allow access from required services once public access is restricted. Review the network access settings regularly to maintain a secure environment. To restrict public network access to your Search Service: 1. Navigate to your Search Service y in the Azure Portal. 2. Under 'Settings'->'Networking', configure the 'Public network access' settings to 'Disabled'. 3. Set up virtual network service endpoints or private endpoints as needed for secure access. 4. Review and adjust IP access rules as necessary.",
