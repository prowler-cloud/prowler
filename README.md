# Description

**Prowler** is an open-source security tool designed to assess and enforce security best practices across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes. It supports tasks such as security audits, incident response, continuous monitoring, system hardening, forensic readiness, and remediation processes.

Prowler includes hundreds of built-in controls to ensure compliance with standards and frameworks, including:

- **Industry Standards:** CIS, NIST 800, NIST CSF, and CISA
- **Regulatory Compliance and Governance:** RBI, FedRAMP, and PCI-DSS
- **Frameworks for Sensitive Data and Privacy:** GDPR, HIPAA, and FFIEC
- **Frameworks for Organizational Governance and Quality Control:** SOC2 and GXP
- **AWS-Specific Frameworks:** AWS Foundational Technical Review (FTR) and AWS Well-Architected Framework (Security Pillar)
- **National Security Standards:** ENS (Spanish National Security Scheme)
- **Custom Security Frameworks:** Tailored to your needs

## Prowler CLI and Prowler Cloud

Prowler offers a Command Line Interface (CLI), known as Prowler Open Source, and an additional service built on top of it, called <a href="https://prowler.com">Prowler Cloud</a>.

## Prowler App

Prowler App is a web-based application that simplifies running Prowler across your cloud provider accounts. It provides a user-friendly interface to visualize the results and streamline your security assessments.

# Deprecations from v3

## General
- `Allowlist` now is called `Mutelist`.
- The `--quiet` option has been deprecated. Use the `--status` flag to filter findings based on their status: PASS, FAIL, or MANUAL.
- All findings with an `INFO` status have been reclassified as `MANUAL`.
- The CSV output format is standardized across all providers.

**Deprecated Output Formats**

The following formats are now deprecated:
- Native JSON has been replaced with JSON in [OCSF] v1.1.0 format, which is standardized across all providers (https://schema.ocsf.io/).

## AWS

**AWS Flag Deprecation**

The flag --sts-endpoint-region has been deprecated due to the adoption of AWS STS regional tokens.

**Sending FAIL Results to AWS Security Hub**

- To send only FAILS to AWS Security Hub, use one of the following options: `--send-sh-only-fails` or `--security-hub --status FAIL`.
