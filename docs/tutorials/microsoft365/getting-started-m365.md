# Getting Started with M365 on Prowler Cloud/App

Set up your M365 account to enable security scanning using Prowler Cloud/App.

## Requirements

To configure your M365 account, you'll need:

1. Obtain a domain from the Entra ID portal.

2. Access Prowler Cloud/App and add a new cloud provider `Microsoft 365`.

3. Configure your M365 account:

    3.1 Create the Service Principal app.

    3.2 Grant the required API permissions.

    3.3 Assign the required roles to your user.

4. Add the credentials to Prowler Cloud/App.

## Step 1: Obtain your Domain

Go to the Entra ID portal, then you can search for `Domain` or go to Identity > Settings > Domain Names.

![Search Domain Names](./img/search-domain-names.png)

## Step 3: Configure your M365 account


### Create the Service Principal app

A Service Principal is required to grant Prowler the necessary privileges.

1. Access **Microsoft Entra ID**

    ![Overview of Microsoft Entra ID](./img/microsoft-entra-id.png)

2. Navigate to `Applications` > `App registrations`

    ![App Registration nav](./img/app-registration-menu.png)

3. Click `+ New registration`, complete the form, and click `Register`

    ![New Registration](./img/new-registration.png)

4. Go to `Certificates & secrets` > `Client secrets` > `+ New client secret`

    ![Certificate & Secrets nav](./img/certificates-and-secrets.png)

5. Fill in the required fields and click `Add`, then copy the generated `value` (that value will be `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`)

    ![New Client Secret](./img/new-client-secret.png)

With this done you will have all the needed keys, summarized in the following table

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Client ID | Application (client) ID |
| Client Secret | AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET |
| Tenant ID | Directory (tenant) ID |

### Grant required Graph API permissions

Assign the following Microsoft Graph permissions:

- `AuditLog.Read.All`: Required for Entra service.
- `Directory.Read.All`: Required for all services.
- `Policy.Read.All`: Required for all services.
- `SharePointTenantSettings.Read.All`: Required for SharePoint service.
- `User.Read` (IMPORTANT: this is set as **delegated**): Required for the sign-in only if using user authentication.

???+ note
    You can replace `Directory.Read.All` with `Domain.Read.All` is a more restrictive permission but you won't be able to run the Entra checks related with DirectoryRoles and GetUsers.

    > If you do this you will need to add also the `Organization.Read.All` permission to the service principal application in order to authenticate.

Follow these steps to assign the permissions:

1. Go to your App Registration > Select your Prowler App created before > click on `API permissions`

    ![API Permission Page](./img/api-permissions-page.png)

2. Click `+ Add a permission` > `Microsoft Graph` > `Application permissions`

    ![Add API Permission](./img/add-app-api-permission.png)

3. Search and select every permission below and once all are selected click on `Add permissions`:
    - `AuditLog.Read.All`: Required for Entra service.
    - `Directory.Read.All`
    - `Policy.Read.All`
    - `SharePointTenantSettings.Read.All`

### Grant PowerShell modules permissions

The permissions you need to grant depends on whether you are using user credentials or service principal to authenticate to the M365 modules.

???+ warning "Warning"
    Make sure you add the correct set of permissions for the authentication method you are using.


#### If using application(service principal) authentication (Recommended)

To grant the permissions for the PowerShell modules via application authentication, you need to add the necessary APIs to your app registration.

???+ warning "Warning"
    You need to have a license that allows you to use the APIs.

1. Add Exchange API:

    - Search and select`Office 365 Exchange Online` API in **APIs my organization uses**.

    ![Office 365 Exchange Online API](./img/search-exchange-api.png)

    - Select `Exchange.ManageAsApp` permission and click on `Add permissions`.

    ![Exchange.ManageAsApp Permission](./img/exchange-permission.png)

    You also need to assign the `Exchange Administrator` role to the app. For that go to `Roles and administrators` and in the `Administrative roles` section click `here` to go to the directory level assignment:

    ![Roles and administrators](./img/here.png)

    Once in the directory level assignment, search for `Exchange Administrator` and click on it to open the assginments page of that role.

    ![Exchange Administrator Role](./img/exchange-administrator-role.png)

    Click on `Add assignments`, search for your app and click on `Assign`.

    You have to select it as `Active` and click on `Assign` to assign the role to the app.

    ![Assign Exchange Administrator Role](./img/assign-exchange-administrator-role.png)

2. Add Teams API:

    - Search and select `Skype and Teams Tenant Admin API` API in **APIs my organization uses**.

    ![Skype and Teams Tenant Admin API](./img/search-skype-teams-tenant-admin-api.png)

    - Select `application_access` permission and click on `Add permissions`.

    ![application_access Permission](./img/teams-permission.png)

3. Click on `Grant admin consent for <your-tenant-name>` to grant admin consent.

    ![Grant Admin Consent](./img/grant-external-api-permissions.png)

    The final result of permission assignment should be this:

    ![Final Permission Assignment](./img/final-permissions.png)

#### If using user authentication

This method is not recommended because it requires a user with MFA enabled and Microsoft will not allow MFA capable users to authenticate programmatically after 1st September 2025. See [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication?tabs=dotnet) for more information.

???+ warning
    Remember that if the user is newly created, you need to sign in with that account first, as Microsoft will prompt you to change the password. If you donâ€™t complete this step, user authentication will fail because Microsoft marks the initial password as expired.


1. Search and select:

    - `User.Read`

    ![Permission Screenshots](./img/directory-permission-delegated.png)

2. Click `Add permissions`, then **grant admin consent**

    ![Grant Admin Consent](./img/grant-admin-consent.png)

    The final result of permission assignment should be this:

    ![Final Permission Assignment](./img/final-permissions-m365.png)

3. Assign **required roles** to your **user**

    Assign one of the following roles to your User:

    - `Global Reader` (recommended): this allows you to read all roles needed.
    - `Exchange Administrator` and `Teams Administrator`: user needs both roles but with this [roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo#microsoft-365-permissions-in-exchange-online) you can access to the same information as a Global Reader (here you only read so that's why we recomend that role).

    Follow these steps to assign the role:

    1. Go to Users > All Users > Click on the email for the user you will use

        ![User Overview](./img/user-info-page.png)

    2. Click `Assigned Roles`

        ![User Roles](./img/user-role-page.png)

    3. Click on `Add assignments`, then search and select:

        - `Global Reader` This is the recommended, if you want to use the others just search for them

        ![Global Reader Screenshots](./img/global-reader.png)

    4. Click on next, then assign the role as `Active`, and click on `Assign` to grant admin consent

        ![Grant Admin Consent for Role](./img/grant-admin-consent-for-role.png)

## Step 4: Add credentials to Prowler Cloud/App

1. Go to your App Registration overview and copy the `Client ID` and `Tenant ID`

    ![App Overview](./img/app-overview.png)


2. Go to Prowler Cloud/App and paste:

    - `Client ID`
    - `Tenant ID`
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` from earlier

    If you are using user authentication, also add:
    - `M365_USER` the user using the correct assigned domain, more info [here](../../getting-started/requirements.md#service-principal-and-user-credentials-authentication-recommended)
    - `M365_PASSWORD` the password of the user
