# Getting Started with M365 on Prowler Cloud/App

Set up your M365 account to enable security scanning using Prowler Cloud/App.

## Requirements

To configure your M365 account, youâ€™ll need:

1. Obtain your `Default Domain` from the Entra ID portal.

2. Access Prowler Cloud/App and add a new cloud provider `Microsoft 365`.

3. Configure your M365 account:

    3.1 Create the Service Principal app.

    3.2 Grant the required API permissions.

    3.3 Assign the required roles to your user.

    3.4 Retrieve your encrypted password.

4. Add the credentials to Prowler Cloud/App.

## Step 1: Obtain your Domain

Go to the Entra ID portal, then you can search for `Domain` or go to Identity > Settings > Domain Names.

![Custom Domain Names](./img/custom-domain-names.png)

Once you are there just look for the `Default Domain` this should be something similar to `YourCompany.onmicrosoft.com`. To ensure that you are picking the correct domain just click on it and verify that the type is `Initial` and you can't delete it.

A Service Principal is required to grant Prowler the necessary privileges.

1. Access **Microsoft Entra ID**

    ![Overview of Microsoft Entra ID](./img/microsoft-entra-id.png)

2. Navigate to `Applications` > `App registrations`

    ![App Registration nav](./img/app-registration-menu.png)

3. Click `+ New registration`, complete the form, and click `Register`

### Assign required roles to your user

Assign one of the following roles to your User:

- `Exchange Administrator` and `Teams Administrator`: user needs both roles but with this [roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo#microsoft-365-permissions-in-exchange-online) you can access to the same information as a Global Reader (here you only read so that's why we recomend that role).

Follow these steps to assign the role:

1. Go to Users > All Users > Click on the email for the user you will use

    ![User Overview](./img/user-info-page.png)

2. Click `Assigned Roles`

    ![User Roles](./img/user-role-page.png)

    - `Global Reader` This is the recommended, if you want to use the others just search for them

4. Click on next, then assign the role as `Active`, and click on `Assign` to grant admin consent

### Get your encrypted password

For this step you will need to use PowerShell, here you will have to create your Encrypted Password based on the password of the User that you are going to use. For more information about how to generate this Password go [here](../../getting-started/requirements.md#service-principal-and-user-credentials-authentication-recommended) and follow the steps needed to obtain `M365_PASSWORD`.

## Step 4: Add credentials to Prowler Cloud/App

1. Go to your App Registration overview and copy the `Client ID` and `Tenant ID`

    ![App Overview](./img/app-overview.png)

2. Go to Prowler Cloud/App and paste:

    - `Client ID`
    - `Tenant ID`
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` from earlier
    - `M365_USER` your user using the default domain, more info [here](../../getting-started/requirements.md#service-principal-and-user-credentials-authentication-recommended)
    - `M365_PASSWORD` generated before
