PowerShell is required by this provider because it is the only way to retrieve data from certain Microsoft 365 services.

## Installing PowerShell

If you are using Prowler Cloud, you don't need to worry about PowerShell â€” it is already installed in our infrastructure.
However, if you want to run Prowler on your own, you must have PowerShell installed to execute the full M365 provider and retrieve all findings.

## Required Modules

The necessary modules will not be installed automatically by Prowler. Nevertheless, if you want Prowler to install them for you, you can execute the provider with the flag `--init-modules`, which will run the script to install and import them.
