In order to scan all the information related with Microsoft Graph you need to use an Application. To know how to create a new Application with all the requirements needed for running Prowler and scanning your Microsoft 365 environment go to [here](./getting-started-m365.md#create-the-service-principal-app).

Once your Application is created you will also need to asign certain roles to allow Prowler obtain the data needed for the checks, you can see how to do that [here](./getting-started-m365.md#grant-required-api-permissions).
