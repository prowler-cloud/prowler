# Prowler App

The **Prowler App** is a user-friendly interface for the Prowler CLI, providing a visual dashboard to monitor your cloud security posture. This tutorial will guide you through setting up and using the Prowler App.

After [installing](../index.md#prowler-app-installation) the **Prowler App**, access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
You can also access to the auto-generated **Prowler API** documentation at [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/docs](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/docs) to see all the available endpoints, parameters and responses.

???+ note
    If you are a [Prowler Cloud](https://cloud.prowler.com/sign-in) user you can see API docs at [https://api.prowler.com/api/v1/docs](https://api.prowler.com/api/v1/docs)

## **Step 1: Sign Up**
To get started, sign up using your email and password:

<img src="../../img/sign-up.png" alt="Sign Up" width="285"/>

---

## **Step 2: Log In**
Once you’ve signed up, log in with your email and password to start using the Prowler App.

You will see the Overview page with no data yet, so let's start adding a provider to scan your cloud environment.

---

## **Step 3: Add a Provider**
To run your first scan, you need to add a cloud provider account. Prowler App supports AWS, Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes.

1. Navigate to `Settings > Cloud Providers`.
2. Click `Add Account` to set up a new provider and provide your credentials:

---

## **Step 4: Configure the Provider**
Choose the provider you want to scan from the following options:

<img src="../../img/select-provider.png" alt="Select a Provider" width="700"/>

Once you’ve selected a provider, you need to provide the Provider UID:

- **AWS**: Enter your AWS Account ID.
- **GCP**: Enter your GCP Project ID.
- **Azure**: Enter your Azure Subscription ID.
- **Kubernetes**: Enter your Kubernetes Cluster context of your kubeconfig file.

Optionally, provide a **Provider Alias** for easier identification. Follow the instructions provided to add your credentials:

---
### **Step 4.1: AWS Credentials**
For AWS, enter your `AWS Account ID` and choose one of the following methods to connect:

#### **Step 4.1.1: IAM Access Keys**
1. Select `Connect via Credentials`.

2. Enter your `Access Key ID`, `Secret Access Key` and optionally a `Session Token`:

    <img src="../../img/aws-credentials.png" alt="AWS Credentials" width="350"/>

#### **Step 4.1.2: IAM Role**
1. Select `Connect assuming IAM Role`.

    <img src="../../img/connect-aws-role.png" alt="AWS Role" width="350"/>

2. Enter the `Role ARN` and any optional field like the AWS Access Keys to assume the role, the `External ID`, the `Role Session Name` or the `Session Duration`:

---

### **Step 4.2: Azure Credentials**
For Azure, Prowler App uses a Service Principal to authenticate. See the steps in https://docs.prowler.com/projects/prowler-open-source/en/latest/tutorials/azure/create-prowler-service-principal/ to create a Service Principal. Then, enter the `Tenant ID`, `Client ID` and `Client Secret` of the Service Principal.

---
### **Step 4.3: GCP Credentials**
To connect your GCP Project, you need to use the Application Default Credentials (ADC) returned by the `gcloud` CLI. Here’s how to set up:

1. Run the following command in your terminal to authenticate with GCP:
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```
2. Once authenticated, get the `Client ID`, `Client Secret` and `Refresh Token` from `~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials`.
3. Paste the `Client ID`, `Client Secret` and `Refresh Token` into the Prowler App.

---
### **Step 4.4: Kubernetes Credentials**
For Kubernetes, Prowler App uses a `kubeconfig` file to authenticate, paste the contents of your `kubeconfig` file into the `Kubeconfig content` field.

By default, the `kubeconfig` file is located at `~/.kube/config`.

---

## **Step 5: Test Connection**
After adding your credentials of your cloud account, click the `Launch` button to verify that the Prowler App can successfully connect to your provider:

<img src="../../img/test-connection-button.png" alt="Test Connection" width="700"/>


## **Step 6: Scan started**
After successfully adding and testing your credentials, Prowler will start scanning your cloud environment, click on the `Go to Scans` button to see the progress:

<img src="../../img/provider-added.png" alt="Start Now" width="700"/>

???+ note
    Prowler will automatically scan all configured providers every **24 hours**, ensuring your cloud environment stays continuously monitored.
---

## **Step 7: Monitor Scan Progress**
Track the progress of your scan in the `Scans` section:

<img src="../../img/scan-progress.png" alt="Scan Progress" width="700"/>

---

## **Step 8: Analyze the Findings**
While the scan is running, start exploring the findings in these sections:

- **Overview**: High-level summary of the scans. <img src="../../img/overview.png" alt="Overview" width="700"/>
- **Compliance**: Insights into compliance status. <img src="../../img/compliance.png" alt="Compliance" width="700"/>
- **Issues**: Types of issues detected.

<img src="../../img/issues.png" alt="Issues" width="300" style="text-align: center;"/>

- **Browse All Findings**: Detailed list of findings detected, where you can filter by severity, service, and more. <img src="../../img/findings.png" alt="Findings" width="700"/>
