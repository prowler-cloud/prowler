# GCP Organization

By default, Prowler scans all Google Cloud projects accessible to the authenticated user.

To limit the scan to projects within a specific Google Cloud organization, use the `--organization-id` option with the GCP organization ID:

```console
prowler gcp --organization-id organization-id
```

???+ warning
    Make sure that the used credentials have the role Cloud Asset Viewer (`roles/cloudasset.viewer`) or Cloud Asset Owner (`roles/cloudasset.owner`) on the organization level.

???+ note
    With this option, Prowler retrieves all projects within the specified organization, including those organized in folders and nested subfolders. This ensures that every project under the organizationâ€™s hierarchy is scanned, providing full visibility across the entire organization.

???+ note
    To find the organization ID, use the following command:

    ```console
    gcloud organizations list
    ```
