# Developer Guide

You can extend Prowler Open Source in many different ways, in most cases you will want to create your own checks and compliance security frameworks, here is where you can learn about how to get started with it. We also include how to create custom outputs, integrations and more.

## Get the code and install all dependencies

First of all, you need a version of Python 3.9 or higher and also pip installed to be able to install all dependencies required. Once that is satisfied go a head and clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler
cd prowler
```
For isolation and avoid conflicts with other environments, we recommend usage of `poetry`:
```
pip install poetry
```
Then install all dependencies including the ones for developers:
```
poetry install --with dev
poetry shell
```

## Contributing with your code or fixes to Prowler

This repo has git pre-commit hooks managed via the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool. [Install](https://pre-commit.com/#install) it how ever you like, then in the root of this repo run:
```shell
pre-commit install
```
You should get an output like the following:
```shell
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Before we merge any of your pull requests we pass checks to the code, we use the following tools and automation to make sure the code is secure and dependencies up-to-dated:
???+ note
    These should have been already installed if you ran `poetry install --with dev`

- [`bandit`](https://pypi.org/project/bandit/) for code security review.
- [`safety`](https://pypi.org/project/safety/) and [`dependabot`](https://github.com/features/security) for dependencies.
- [`hadolint`](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) and [`dockle`](https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle) for our containers security.
- [`Snyk`](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/snyk-container-integrations/container-security-with-docker-hub-integration) in Docker Hub.
- [`clair`](https://github.com/quay/clair) in Amazon ECR.
- [`vulture`](https://pypi.org/project/vulture/), [`flake8`](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/), [`black`](https://pypi.org/project/black/) and [`pylint`](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) for formatting and best practices.

You can see all dependencies in file `pyproject.toml`.

Moreover, you would need to install [`TruffleHog`](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) to check for secrets in the code. You can install it using the official installation guide [here](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog?tab=readme-ov-file#floppy_disk-installation).
