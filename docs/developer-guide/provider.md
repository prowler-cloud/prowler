# Create a new Provider for Prowler

Here you can find how to create a new Provider in Prowler to give support for making all security checks needed and make your cloud safer!

## Introduction

Providers are the foundation on which Prowler is built, a simple definition for a cloud provider could be "third-party company that offers a platform where any IT resource you need is available at any time upon request". The most well-known cloud providers are Amazon Web Services, Azure from Microsoft and Google Cloud which are already supported by Prowler.

To create a new provider that is not supported now by Prowler and add your security checks you must create a new folder to store all the related files within it (services, checks, etc.). It must be store in route `prowler/providers/<new_provider_name>/`.

Inside that folder, you MUST create the following files and folders:

- A `lib` folder: to store all extra functions.
- A `services` folder: to store all [services](./services.md) to audit.
- An empty `__init__.py`: to make Python treat this service folder as a package.
- A `<new_provider_name>_provider.py`, containing all the provider's logic necessary to get authenticated in the provider, configurations and extra data useful for final report.
- A `models.py`, containing all the models necessary for the new provider.

## Provider

The structure for Prowler's providers is set up in such a way that they can be utilized through a generic service specific to each provider. This is achieved by passing the required parameters to the constructor, which in turn initializes all the necessary session values.

### Base Class

All the providers in Prowler inherits from the same [base class](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/blob/master/prowler/providers/common/provider.py). It is an [abstract base class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html) that defines the interface for all provider classes. The code of the class is the next:

```python title="Provider Base Class"

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Any

class Provider(ABC):
    """
    The Provider class is an abstract base class that defines the interface for all provider classes in the auditing system.

    Attributes:
        type (property): The type of the provider.
        identity (property): The identity of the provider for auditing.
        session (property): The session of the provider for auditing.
        audit_config (property): The audit configuration of the provider.
        output_options (property): The output configuration of the provider for auditing.

    Methods:
        print_credentials(): Displays the provider's credentials used for auditing in the command-line interface.
        setup_session(): Sets up the session for the provider.
        get_output_mapping(): Returns the output mapping between the provider and the generic model.
        validate_arguments(): Validates the arguments for the provider.
        get_checks_to_execute_by_audit_resources(): Returns a set of checks based on the input resources to scan.

    Note:
        This is an abstract base class and should not be instantiated directly. Each provider should implement its own
        version of the Provider class by inheriting from this base class and implementing the required methods and properties.

### Provider Class

Due to the complexity and differences of each provider use the rest of the providers as a template for the implementation.

- [AWS](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/blob/master/prowler/providers/aws/aws_provider.py)
- [GCP](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/blob/master/prowler/providers/gcp/gcp_provider.py)
- [Azure](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/blob/master/prowler/providers/azure/azure_provider.py)
- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/blob/master/prowler/providers/kubernetes/kubernetes_provider.py)

To facilitate understanding here is a pseudocode of how the most basic provider could be with examples.
