## Contributing to Documentation

Prowler documentation is built using `mkdocs`, allowing contributors to easily add or enhance documentation. 

Installation and Setup  

Install all necessary dependencies using: `poetry install --with docs`.

1. Install `mkdocs` using your preferred package manager.
2. Running the Documentation Locally  
Navigate to the `prowler` repository folder.  
Start the local documentation server by running: `mkdocs serve`.  
Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to view live updates.
3. Making Documentation Changes  
Make all needed changes to docs or add new documents. Edit existing Markdown (.md) files inside `prowler/docs`.  
To add new sections or files, update the `mkdocs.yaml` file located in the root directory of Prowler’s repository.
4. Submitting Changes  

Once documentation updates are complete:  
  
Submit a pull request for review.  
  
The Prowler team will assess and merge contributions.
