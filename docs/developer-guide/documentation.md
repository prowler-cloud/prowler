## Contribute with documentation

We use `mkdocs` to build this Prowler documentation site so you can easily contribute back with new docs or improving them. To install all necessary dependencies use `poetry install --with docs`.

1. Install `mkdocs` with your favorite package manager.
2. Inside the `prowler` repository folder run `mkdocs serve` and point your browser to `http://localhost:8000` and you will see live changes to your local copy of this documentation site.
3. Make all needed changes to docs or add new documents. To do so just edit existing md files inside `prowler/docs` and if you are adding a new section or file please make sure you add it to `mkdocs.yaml` file in the root folder of the Prowler repo.
4. Once you are done with changes, please send a pull request to us for review and merge. Thank you in advance!
