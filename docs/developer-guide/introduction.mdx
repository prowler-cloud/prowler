## Setting up your development environment

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:

- Git is installed.
- Python 3.9 or higher is installed.
- `poetry` is installed to manage dependencies.

### Forking the Prowler Repository

Fork the Prowler GitHub repository to contribute to Prowler. This allows proposing changes, submitting new features, and fixing bugs. For guidance on forking, refer to the [official GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo?tool=webui#forking-a-repository).

### Cloning Your Forked Repository

Once your fork is created, clone it using the following commands (replace `<your-github-user>` with your GitHub username):

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-user>/prowler
cd prowler
```

### Dependency Management and Environment Isolation

To prevent conflicts between environments, we recommend using `poetry`, a Python dependency management solution. Install it by following the [instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

### Installing Dependencies

To install all required dependencies, including those needed for development, run:

```
poetry install --with dev
eval $(poetry env activate)
```

<Warning>
Starting from Poetry v2.0.0, `poetry shell` has been deprecated in favor of `poetry env activate`.
If your poetry version is below 2.0.0 you must keep using `poetry shell` to activate your environment.
In case you have any doubts, consult the [Poetry environment activation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/#activating-the-environment).

</Warning>


### Pre-Commit Hooks

This repository uses Git pre-commit hooks managed by the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool, it is installed with `poetry install --with dev`. Next, run the following command in the root of this repository:

```shell
pre-commit install
```

Successful installation should produce the following output:

```shell
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Code Quality and Security Checks

Before merging pull requests, several automated checks and utilities ensure code security and updated dependencies:

<Note>
These should have been already installed if `poetry install --with dev` was already run.

</Note>
- [`bandit`](https://pypi.org/project/bandit/) for code security review.
- [`safety`](https://pypi.org/project/safety/) and [`dependabot`](https://github.com/features/security) for dependencies.
- [`hadolint`](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) and [`dockle`](https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle) for container security.
- [`Snyk`](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/snyk-container-integrations/container-security-with-docker-hub-integration) for container security in Docker Hub.
- [`clair`](https://github.com/quay/clair) for container security in Amazon ECR.
- [`vulture`](https://pypi.org/project/vulture/), [`flake8`](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/), [`black`](https://pypi.org/project/black/), and [`pylint`](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) for formatting and best practices.

Additionally, ensure the latest version of [`TruffleHog`](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) is installed to scan for sensitive data in the code. Follow the official [installation guide](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog?tab=readme-ov-file#floppy_disk-installation) for setup.

### AI-Driven Contributions

If you are using AI assistants to help with your contributions, Prowler provides specialized resources to enhance AI-driven development:

- **Prowler MCP Server**: The [Prowler MCP Server](/getting-started/products/prowler-mcp) provides AI assistants with access to the entire Prowler ecosystem, including security checks, compliance frameworks, documentation, and more. This enables AI tools to better understand Prowler's architecture and help you create contributions that align with project standards.

- **AGENTS.md Files**: Each component of the Prowler monorepo includes an `AGENTS.md` file that contains specific guidelines for AI agents working on that component. These files provide context about project structure, coding standards, and best practices. When working on a specific component, refer to the relevant `AGENTS.md` file (e.g., `prowler/AGENTS.md`, `ui/AGENTS.md`, `api/AGENTS.md`) to ensure your AI assistant follows the appropriate guidelines.

- **AI Skills System**: The [AI Skills system](/developer-guide/ai-skills) provides on-demand patterns, templates, and best practices for AI agents. Skills help AI assistants understand Prowler's conventions and generate code that aligns with project standards. The skills are located in the `skills/` directory and are registered in the `AGENTS.md` files.

These resources help ensure that AI-assisted contributions maintain consistency with Prowler's codebase and development practices.

### Dependency Management

All dependencies are listed in the `pyproject.toml` file.

For proper code documentation, refer to the following and follow the code documentation practices presented there: [Google Python Style Guide - Comments and Docstrings](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings).

<Note>
If you encounter issues when committing to the Prowler repository, use the `--no-verify` flag with the `git commit` command.

</Note>
### Repository Folder Structure

The Prowler codebase layout helps quickly locate where to add new features, checks, or integrations. The following is a high-level overview from the root of the repository:

```

## Contribution Appreciation

If you enjoy swag, we'd love to thank you for your contribution with laptop stickers or other Prowler merchandise!

To request swag: Share your pull request details in our [Slack workspace](https://goto.prowler.com/slack).

You can also reach out to Toni de la Fuente on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ToniBlyx)—his DMs are open!

## Testing a Pull Request from a Specific Branch

To test Prowler from a specific branch (for example, to try out changes from a pull request before it is merged), you can use `pipx` to install directly from GitHub:

```sh
pipx install "git+https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler.git@branch-name"
```

Replace `branch-name` with the name of the branch you want to test. This will install Prowler in an isolated environment, allowing you to try out the changes safely.

For more details on testing go to the [Testing section](/developer-guide/unit-testing) of this documentation.
