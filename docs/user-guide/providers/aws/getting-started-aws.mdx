### Step 3: Set Up AWS Authentication

Before proceeding, choose the preferred authentication mode:

**Credentials**

* Quick scan as current user
* No extra setup
* Credentials time out

**Assumed Role**

* Preferred Setup
* Permanent Credentials
* Requires access to create role

#### Assume Role (Recommended)

This method grants permanent access and is the recommended setup for production environments.

![Assume Role Overview](/images/providers/assume-role-overview.png)

For detailed instructions on how to create the role, see [Authentication > Assume Role](/user-guide/providers/aws/authentication#assume-role-recommended).

8. Once the role is created, go to the **IAM Console**, click on the "ProwlerScan" role to open its details:

    ![ProwlerScan role info](/images/providers/prowler-scan-pre-info.png)

9. Copy the **Role ARN**

    ![New Role Info](/images/providers/get-role-arn.png)

10. Paste the ARN into the corresponding field in Prowler Cloud or Prowler App

    ![Input the Role ARN](/images/providers/paste-role-arn-prowler.png)

11. Click "Next", then "Launch Scan"

#### Credentials (Static Access Keys)

AWS accounts can also be configured using static credentials (not recommended for long-term use):

![Connect via credentials](/images/providers/connect-via-credentials.png)

For detailed instructions on how to create the credentials, see [Authentication > Credentials](/user-guide/providers/aws/authentication#credentials).

1. Complete the form in Prowler Cloud or Prowler App and click "Next"

## Prowler CLI

### Configure AWS Credentials

To authenticate with AWS, use one of the following methods:

```console
aws configure
```

or

```console
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="ASXXXXXXX"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="XXXXXXXXX"
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="XXXXXXXXX"
```

These credentials must be associated with a user or role with the necessary permissions to perform security checks.

More details on Assume Role settings from the CLI in [Assume Role](/user-guide/providers/aws/role-assumption) page.


### AWS Profiles

To use a custom AWS profile, specify it with the following command:

```console
prowler aws -p/--profile <profile_name>
```

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

For IAM entities requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), use the `--mfa` flag. Prowler prompts for the following values to initiate a new session:

- **ARN of your MFA device**
- **TOTP (time-based one-time password)**
