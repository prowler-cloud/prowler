title: 'MongoDB Atlas Authentication'
---

MongoDB Atlas provider uses [HTTP Digest Authentication with API key pairs consisting of a public key and private key](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/configure-api-access/#grant-programmatic-access-to-service).


## Required Permissions

MongoDB Atlas API keys require appropriate permissions to perform security checks:

- **Organization Read Only**: Provides read-only access to everything in the organization, including all projects in the organization.
    - To [audit the Auditing configuration for the project](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/api/doc/atlas-admin-api-v2/group/endpoint-auditing), **Organization Owner** permission is required.

The IP address where Prowler runs must be added to the IP Access List of the MongoDB Atlas organization API key. To skip this step and use the API key across all IP address types, uncheck the "Require IP Access List for the Atlas Administration API" button in Organization Settings. This setting is [enabled by default](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/configure-api-access/#optional--require-an-ip-access-list-for-the-atlas-administration-api).

<Warning>
To ensure the check `organizations_api_access_list_required` passes, enable the API access list for the organization and add the execution IP to the organization's IP Access List. When running checks from Prowler Cloud, add our IP to the IP Access List.

6. **Save Credentials**: Record both the public and private keys, then store them securely

7. **Add IP Access List**: Add the IP address where Prowler runs to the API Key's IP Access List. To skip this step and use the API key for all IP addresses, uncheck the "Require IP Access List for the Atlas Administration API" button in [Organization Settings](#required-permissions), though this is not recommended.
