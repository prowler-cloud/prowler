Prowler's Image provider enables comprehensive container image security scanning by integrating with [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/). This provider detects vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, and misconfigurations in container images, converting Trivy findings into Prowler's standard reporting format for unified security assessment.

## Prowler CLI

<VersionBadge version="5.19.0" />

<Note>
The Image provider is currently available in Prowler CLI only.
</Note>

### Prerequisites

Before using the Image provider, ensure the following requirements are met:

- **Prowler CLI**: Version 5.19.0 or later
- **Trivy installed**: Trivy must be installed and available in the system PATH
- **Container images accessible**: Images must be pullable from container registries or available locally
- **Registry authentication** (for private registries): Valid Docker credentials configured via `docker login`

### Installation

#### Install Trivy

Install Trivy using one of the following methods:

**Using Homebrew (macOS/Linux):**
```bash
brew install trivy
```

**Using apt (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt-get install trivy
```

**Using the install script:**
```bash
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/trivy/main/contrib/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```

For additional installation methods, see the [Trivy installation guide](https://trivy.dev/latest/getting-started/installation/).

#### Verify Installation

```bash
trivy --version
```

### Usage

#### Basic Usage

To scan a single container image:

```bash
prowler image -I alpine:3.18
```

#### Scanning Multiple Images

Multiple images can be specified by repeating the `-I` flag:

```bash
prowler image -I nginx:latest -I redis:7 -I python:3.12-slim
```

#### Scanning From an Image List File

For large-scale scanning, provide a file containing one image per line:

```bash
prowler image --image-list images.txt
```

The file supports comments (lines starting with `#`) and blank lines:

```text
# Production images
nginx:1.25
redis:7-alpine

# Development images
python:3.12-slim
node:20-bookworm
```

<Note>
Image list files are limited to a maximum of 10,000 lines. Individual image names exceeding 500 characters are automatically skipped with a warning.
</Note>

#### Image Name Requirements

Image names must follow the OCI reference format. Valid names start with an alphanumeric character and contain only letters, digits, periods, hyphens, underscores, slashes, colons, and `@` symbols.

Valid examples:
* `alpine:3.18`
* `myregistry.io/myapp:v1.0`
* `ghcr.io/org/image@sha256:abc123...`

<Warning>
Image names containing shell metacharacters (`;`, `|`, `&`, `$`, `` ` ``) are rejected to prevent command injection.
</Warning>

### Scan Configuration

#### Scanner Types

Control which scanners Trivy runs using the `--scanners` option. By default, Prowler enables `vuln` and `secret` scanners:

```bash
# Vulnerability scanning only
prowler image -I alpine:3.18 --scanners vuln

# All available scanners
prowler image -I alpine:3.18 --scanners vuln secret misconfig license
```

Available scanners:

- **vuln**: Detects known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in OS packages and application dependencies
- **secret**: Identifies exposed secrets such as API keys, passwords, and tokens
- **misconfig**: Checks Dockerfile best practices and configuration issues
- **license**: Scans for software license compliance

#### Image Config Scanners

To scan Dockerfile-level metadata for misconfigurations or embedded secrets, use the `--image-config-scanners` option:

```bash
# Scan Dockerfile for misconfigurations
prowler image -I alpine:3.18 --image-config-scanners misconfig

# Scan Dockerfile for both misconfigurations and secrets
prowler image -I alpine:3.18 --image-config-scanners misconfig secret
```

Available image config scanners:

- **misconfig**: Detects Dockerfile misconfigurations (e.g., running as root, missing health checks)
- **secret**: Identifies secrets embedded in Dockerfile instructions

<Note>
Image config scanners are disabled by default. This option is independent from `--scanners` and specifically targets the image configuration (Dockerfile) rather than the image filesystem.
</Note>

#### Severity Filtering

To filter findings by severity level, use the `--trivy-severity` option:

```bash
# Only critical and high severity findings
prowler image -I alpine:3.18 --trivy-severity CRITICAL HIGH
```

Available severity levels: `CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, `UNKNOWN`.

#### Ignoring Unfixed Vulnerabilities

To exclude vulnerabilities without available fixes:

```bash
prowler image -I alpine:3.18 --ignore-unfixed
```

#### Scan Timeout

Adjust the scan timeout for large images or slow network conditions:

```bash
prowler image -I large-image:latest --timeout 10m
```

The timeout accepts values in seconds (`s`), minutes (`m`), or hours (`h`). Default: `5m`.

### Output Options

The Image provider supports all standard Prowler output formats:

```bash
# JSON output
prowler image -I alpine:3.18 --output-format json

# CSV output
prowler image -I alpine:3.18 --output-format csv

# HTML report
prowler image -I alpine:3.18 --output-format html
```

### Authentication for Private Registries

The Image provider relies on Trivy for registry authentication. To scan images from private registries, configure Docker credentials before running the scan:

```bash
# Log in to a private registry
docker login myregistry.io

# Then scan the image
prowler image -I myregistry.io/myapp:v1.0
```

Trivy automatically uses credentials from Docker's credential store (`~/.docker/config.json`).

### Troubleshooting

The Image provider categorizes common Trivy errors with actionable guidance:

* **Authentication failure (401/403):** Registry credentials are missing or invalid. Run `docker login` for the target registry and retry the scan.
* **Image not found (404):** The specified image name, tag, or registry is incorrect. Verify the image reference exists and is accessible.
* **Rate limited (429):** The container registry is throttling requests. Wait before retrying, or authenticate to increase rate limits.
* **Network issue:** Trivy cannot reach the registry due to connectivity problems. Check network access, DNS resolution, and firewall rules.
