Prowler Lighthouse AI is a Cloud Security Analyst chatbot that helps you understand, prioritize, and remediate security findings in your cloud environments. It's designed to provide security expertise for teams without dedicated resources, acting as your 24/7 virtual cloud security analyst.

## How It Works

Prowler Lighthouse AI integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with your Prowler security findings data.

Here's what's happening behind the scenes:

- The system uses a multi-agent architecture built with [LanggraphJS](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraphjs) for LLM logic and [Vercel AI SDK UI](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview) for frontend chatbot.
- It uses a ["supervisor" architecture](https://langchain-ai.lang.chat/langgraphjs/tutorials/multi_agent/agent_supervisor/) that interacts with different agents for specialized tasks. For example, `findings_agent` can analyze detected security findings, while `overview_agent` provides a summary of connected cloud accounts.
- The system connects to the configured LLM provider to understand user's query, fetches the right data, and responds to the query.
<Note>
Lighthouse AI supports multiple LLM providers including OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, and OpenAI-compatible services. For configuration details, see [Using Multiple LLM Providers with Lighthouse](/user-guide/tutorials/prowler-app-lighthouse-multi-llm).
</Note>
- The supervisor agent is the main contact point. It is what users interact with directly from the chat interface. It coordinates with other agents to answer users' questions comprehensively.

<Note>
All agents can only read relevant security data. They cannot modify your data or access sensitive information like configured secrets or tenant details.

### Adding Business Context

The optional business context field lets you provide additional information to help Lighthouse AI understand your environment and priorities, including:

- Your organization's cloud security goals
- Information about account owners or responsible teams
- Compliance requirements for your organization
- Current security initiatives or focus areas

Better context leads to more relevant responses and prioritization that aligns with your needs.

## Capabilities

Prowler Lighthouse AI is designed to be your AI security team member, with capabilities including:

### Natural Language Querying

Ask questions in plain English about your security findings. Examples:

- "What are my highest risk findings?"
- "Show me all S3 buckets with public access."
- "What security issues were found in my production accounts?"

### Detailed Remediation Guidance

Get tailored step-by-step instructions for fixing security issues:

- Clear explanations of the problem and its impact
- Commands or console steps to implement fixes
- Alternative approaches with different solutions

### Enhanced Context and Analysis

Lighthouse AI can provide additional context to help you understand the findings:

- Explain security concepts related to findings in simple terms
- Provide risk assessments based on your environment and context
- Connect related findings to show broader security patterns

## Important Notes

Prowler Lighthouse AI is powerful, but there are limitations:

- **Continuous improvement**: Please report any issues, as the feature may make mistakes or encounter errors, despite extensive testing.
- **Access limitations**: Lighthouse AI can only access data the logged-in user can view. If you can't see certain information, Lighthouse AI can't see it either.
- **NextJS session dependence**: If your Prowler application session expires or logs out, Lighthouse AI will error out. Refresh and log back in to continue.
- **Response quality**: The response quality depends on the selected LLM provider and model. Choose models with strong tool-calling capabilities for best results. We recommend `gpt-5` model from OpenAI.

### What Data Is Shared to LLM Providers?

The following API endpoints are accessible to Prowler Lighthouse AI. Data from the following API endpoints could be shared with LLM provider depending on the scope of user's query:

#### Accessible API Endpoints

**User Management:**

- List all users - `/api/v1/users`
- Retrieve the current user's information - `/api/v1/users/me`

**Provider Management:**

- List all providers - `/api/v1/providers`
- Retrieve data from a provider - `/api/v1/providers/{id}`

**Scan Management:**

- List all scans - `/api/v1/scans`
- Retrieve data from a specific scan - `/api/v1/scans/{id}`

**Resource Management:**

- List all resources - `/api/v1/resources`
- Retrieve data for a resource - `/api/v1/resources/{id}`

**Findings Management:**

- List all findings - `/api/v1/findings`

#### Excluded API Endpoints

Not all Prowler API endpoints are integrated with Lighthouse AI. They are intentionally excluded for the following reasons:

- OpenAI/other LLM providers shouldn't have access to sensitive data (like fetching provider secrets and other sensitive config)
- Users queries don't need responses from those API endpoints (ex: tasks, tenant details, downloading zip file, etc.)

**Excluded Endpoints:**

## FAQs

**1. Which LLM providers are supported?**

Lighthouse AI supports three providers:

- **OpenAI** - GPT models (GPT-5, GPT-4o, etc.)
- **Amazon Bedrock** - Claude, Llama, Titan, and other models via AWS
- **OpenAI Compatible** - Custom endpoints like OpenRouter, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible service

For detailed configuration instructions, see [Using Multiple LLM Providers with Lighthouse](/user-guide/tutorials/prowler-app-lighthouse-multi-llm).

**2. Why a multi-agent supervisor model?**

Context windows are limited. While demo data fits inside the context window, querying real-world data often exceeds it. A multi-agent architecture is used so different agents fetch different sizes of data and respond with the minimum required data to the supervisor. This spreads the context window usage across agents.

**3. Is my security data shared with LLM providers?**

Minimal data is shared to generate useful responses. Agents can access security findings and remediation details when needed. Provider secrets are protected by design and cannot be read. The LLM provider credentials configured with Lighthouse AI are only accessible to our NextJS server and are never sent to the LLM providers. Resource metadata (names, tags, account/project IDs, etc) may be shared with your configured LLM provider based on your query requirements.

**4. Can the Lighthouse AI change my cloud environment?**

No. The agent doesn't have the tools to make the changes, even if the configured cloud provider API keys contain permissions to modify resources.
