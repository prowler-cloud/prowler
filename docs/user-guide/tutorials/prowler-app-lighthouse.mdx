Prowler Lighthouse AI integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Prowler security findings data.

Behind the scenes, Lighthouse AI works as follows:

- Lighthouse AI runs as a [Langchain agent](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langchain/agents) in NextJS
- The agent connects to the configured LLM provider to understand the prompt and decide what data is needed
- The agent accesses Prowler data through [Prowler MCP](https://docs.prowler.com/getting-started/products/prowler-mcp), which exposes tools from multiple sources, including:
  - Prowler Hub
  - Prowler Docs
  - Prowler App
- Instead of calling every tool directly, the agent uses two meta-tools:
  - `describe_tool` to retrieve a tool schema and parameter requirements.
  - `execute_tool` to run the selected tool with the required input.
- Based on the user's query and the data necessary to answer it, Lighthouse agent will invoke necessary Prowler MCP tools using `discover_tool` and `execute_tool`

<Note>
Lighthouse AI supports multiple LLM providers including OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, and OpenAI-compatible services. For configuration details, see [Using Multiple LLM Providers with Lighthouse](/user-guide/tutorials/prowler-app-lighthouse-multi-llm).

<Note>
Lighthouse AI can only read relevant security data. It cannot modify data or access sensitive information such as configured secrets or tenant details.

## Set Up

Getting started with Prowler Lighthouse AI is easy:

1. Navigate to **Configuration** → **Lighthouse AI**
2. Click **Connect** under the desired provider (OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, or OpenAI Compatible)
3. Enter the required credentials
4. Select a default model
5. Click **Connect** to save

<Note>
For detailed configuration instructions for each provider, see [Using Multiple LLM Providers with Lighthouse](/user-guide/tutorials/prowler-app-lighthouse-multi-llm).

### Adding Business Context

The optional business context field lets teams provide additional information to help Lighthouse AI understand environment priorities, including:

- Organization cloud security goals
- Information about account owners or responsible teams
- Compliance requirements
- Current security initiatives or focus areas

Better context leads to more relevant responses and prioritization that aligns with your needs.
