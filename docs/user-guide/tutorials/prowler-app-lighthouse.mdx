title: 'How It Works'
---

Prowler Lighthouse AI integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Prowler security findings data.

Here's what's happening behind the scenes:

- The system uses a multi-agent architecture built with [LanggraphJS](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraphjs) for LLM logic and [Vercel AI SDK UI](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview) for frontend chatbot.
- It uses a ["supervisor" architecture](https://langchain-ai.lang.chat/langgraphjs/tutorials/multi_agent/agent_supervisor/) that interacts with different agents for specialized tasks. For example, `findings_agent` can analyze detected security findings, while `overview_agent` provides a summary of connected cloud accounts.
- The system connects to the configured LLM provider to understand user's query, fetches the right data, and responds to the query.
<Note>
Lighthouse AI supports multiple LLM providers including OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, and OpenAI-compatible services. For configuration details, see [Using Multiple LLM Providers with Lighthouse](/user-guide/tutorials/prowler-app-lighthouse-multi-llm).
</Note>
- The supervisor agent is the main contact point. It is what users interact with directly from the chat interface. It coordinates with other agents to answer users' questions comprehensively.

<Note>
All agents can only read relevant security data. They cannot modify your data or access sensitive information like configured secrets or tenant details.

## Set up

Getting started with Prowler Lighthouse AI is easy:

1. Navigate to **Configuration** → **Lighthouse AI**
2. Click **Connect** under the desired provider (OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, or OpenAI Compatible)
3. Enter the required credentials
4. Select a default model
5. Click **Connect** to save

<Note>
For detailed configuration instructions for each provider, see [Using Multiple LLM Providers with Lighthouse](/user-guide/tutorials/prowler-app-lighthouse-multi-llm).

### Adding Business Context

The optional business context field lets you provide additional information to help Lighthouse AI understand your environment and priorities, including:

- Your organization's cloud security goals
- Information about account owners or responsible teams
- Compliance requirements for your organization
- Current security initiatives or focus areas

Better context leads to more relevant responses and prioritization that aligns with your needs.
