title: 'Prowler Cloud Public IPs'
---

## Overview

Prowler Cloud uses a dedicated egress IPv4 address for all outbound connections to customer infrastructure. This enables organizations to implement network-level security controls by whitelisting Prowler's IP address.

## Use Cases

Whitelisting Prowler's egress IP address enables:

- **Credential Usage Control**: Restrict where cloud provider credentials can be used from across AWS, Azure, GCP, and other providers
- **Kubernetes Security**: Limit inbound HTTPS traffic to clusters by allowing only Prowler's IP address
- **Compliance Requirements**: Meet security policies requiring allowlisting of external services

## Query the Egress IP Address

Retrieve Prowler Cloud's current egress IP address using the following command:

```bash
dig egress.prowler.com +short
```

This command returns the IPv4 address that Prowler Cloud uses for all outbound connections to customer infrastructure.

<Note>
The egress IP address is stable, but it is recommended to periodically verify it remains current by querying `egress.prowler.com`.
