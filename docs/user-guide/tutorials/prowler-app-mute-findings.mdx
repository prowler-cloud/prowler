Prowler App allows users to mute specific findings to focus on the most critical security issues. This guide demonstrates how to use the Advanced Mutelist feature with YAML configuration for complex, pattern-based muting rules.

<Note>
For muting individual findings without YAML configuration, use [Simple Mutelist](/user-guide/tutorials/prowler-app-simple-mutelist) to mute findings directly from the Findings table.

</Note>

## What Is Advanced Mutelist?

Advanced Mutelist enables users to create powerful, pattern-based muting rules using YAML configuration:

- **Define complex muting patterns** using regular expressions
- **Mute findings by check, region, resource, or tag** across multiple accounts
- **Apply wildcards** to mute entire categories of findings
- **Create exceptions** within broad muting rules
- **Maintain audit trails** of muted findings for compliance purposes

## Prerequisites

Before muting findings, ensure:

- Valid access to Prowler App with appropriate permissions
- A provider added to the Prowler App
- Understanding of the security implications of muting specific findings

<Warning>
Muting findings does not resolve underlying security issues. Review each finding carefully before muting to ensure it represents an acceptable risk or has been properly addressed.

</Warning>
## Step 1: Connect a Provider

To configure Advanced Mutelist:

1. Log into Prowler App
2. Navigate to the Providers page
![Add provider](/images/mutelist-ui-1.png)
3. Connect a provider to enable Mutelist configuration
![Button enabled in providers page](/images/mutelist-ui-2.png)
![Button enabled in scans pages](/images/mutelist-ui-3.png)


## Step 2: Configure Advanced Mutelist

1. Navigate to the Mutelist page from the left navigation menu
2. Select the "Advanced" tab
3. Provide a valid Mutelist configuration in `YAML` format

<Note>
The YAML format follows the same specification as Prowler CLI. See [CLI Mutelist documentation](/user-guide/cli/tutorials/mutelist) for detailed syntax reference.

</Note>
![Valid YAML configuration](/images/mutelist-ui-5.png)
If the YAML configuration is invalid, an error message will be displayed
![Wrong YAML configuration](/images/mutelist-ui-7.png)
![Wrong YAML configuration 2](/images/mutelist-ui-8.png)

## Step 3: Review and Update the Configuration

1. Once added, the configuration can be updated or removed from the Advanced tab
![Remove or update configuration](/images/mutelist-ui-6.png)

## Step 4: Verify Muted Findings in Scan Results

1. Run a new scan
2. Navigate to the Findings page to verify muted findings
![Check muted findings](/images/mutelist-ui-9.png)

<Note>
The Advanced Mutelist configuration takes effect on subsequent scans. Existing findings are not retroactively muted.

</Note>

            - "*"
          Resources:
            - ".*-test-.*"        # Matches any resource containing "-test-"
            - "dev-.*"            # Matches resources starting with "dev-"
            - ".*-prod$"          # Matches resources ending with "-prod"
          Description: "Mute findings for test and development resources using regex"
```

#### Using Exceptions
```yaml

  Accounts:
    "*":
      Checks:
        "*":
          Regions:
            - "*"
          Resources:
            - "*"
          Exceptions:
            Accounts:
              - "987654321098"
            Regions:
              - "us-west-2"
            Resources:
              - "critical-resource"
            Tags:
              - "environment=production"
          Description: "Mute all findings except for critical production resources"
```

#### Tag-Based Logic
```yaml
Mutelist:
  Accounts:
    "*":
      Checks:
        "*":
          Regions:
            - "*"
          Resources:
            - "*"
          Tags:
            - "environment=dev | environment=test"    # OR logic
            - "project=alpha"                      # AND logic
          Description: "Mute findings for dev/test environments in alpha project"
```

### Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with specific resources and gradually expand
2. **Document Reasons**: Always include descriptions for audit trails
3. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review muted findings
4. **Use Tags**: Leverage resource tags for better organization
5. **Test Changes**: Validate mutelist changes in non-production environments
6. **Monitor Impact**: Track how muting affects your security posture

### Validation

Prowler App validates your mutelist configuration and will display errors for:

- Invalid YAML syntax
- Missing required fields
- Invalid regular expressions
- Unsupported provider-specific configurations
