**Prowler App** supports multiple users within a single tenant, enabling seamless collaboration by allowing team members to easily share insights and manage security findings.

[Roles](#roles) help you control user permissions, determining what actions each user can perform and the data they can access within Prowler. By default, each account includes an immutable **admin** role, ensuring that your account always retains administrative access.

<Note>
If the account is created without an invitation, a new tenant will be provisioned for it. However, if the account is created through an invitation, the user will join the inviter’s tenant.

</Note>
## Organization

To get to User-Invitation Management we will focus on the Organization section.

<Note>
**Only users that have the _Invite and Manage Users_ or _admin_ permission can access this section.**

## Managing Groups and Roles

The Roles section in Prowler is designed to facilitate the assignment of custom user privileges. This section allows administrators to define roles with specific permissions for Prowler administrative tasks and Account visibility.

<Note>
**Only users that have the _Manage Account_ or _admin_ permission can access this section.**

</Note>
### Provider Groups

Provider Groups control visibility across specific providers. When creating a new role, you can assign specific groups to define their Cloud Provider visibility. This ensures that users with that role have access only to the Cloud Providers that are required.

By default, a new user role does not have visibility into any group.

Alternatively, to grant the role unlimited visibility across all providers, check the Grant Unlimited Visibility checkbox.
