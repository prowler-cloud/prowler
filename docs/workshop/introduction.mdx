# Prowler Workshop

Welcome to the Prowler Workshop. This hands-on training provides practical experience with Prowler's cloud security monitoring and compliance automation capabilities across multiple cloud platforms.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop consists of eight progressive labs designed to guide you through Prowler's core features and advanced capabilities:

* **Lab 1:** Getting Started with Prowler CLI
* **Lab 2:** Threat Detection with Prowler
* **Lab 3:** Custom Checks with Prowler
* **Lab 4:** Multi-Cloud Security with Prowler (Azure)
* **Lab 5:** Multi-Cloud Security with Prowler (GCP)
* **Lab 6:** Compliance as Code with Prowler
* **Lab 7:** Integrations with Prowler (AWS Security Hub)
* **Lab 8:** Prowler SaaS Platform

## Lab Structure

Each lab is self-contained and includes:

* **Prerequisites:** Required cloud accounts, tools, and prior lab dependencies
* **Objectives:** Clear learning goals for the lab
* **Step-by-step instructions:** Detailed guidance through each task
* **Expected outcomes:** What you should achieve by completing the lab
* **Verification steps:** How to confirm successful completion

## Prerequisites Approach

Each lab specifies its own prerequisites, as different labs require different cloud provider accounts, tools, and access levels. Review the prerequisites section at the beginning of each lab before starting.

## How to Use This Workshop

* Labs are designed to be completed sequentially, as later labs may build on concepts from earlier ones
* Estimated time to complete varies by lab (typically 30-60 minutes each)
* You can pause between labs and resume later
* Some labs can be completed independently if you have the necessary prerequisites
