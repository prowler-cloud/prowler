## High level architecture

You can run Prowler from your workstation, a Kubernetes Job, a Google Compute Engine, an Azure VM, an EC2 instance, Fargate or any other container, CloudShell and many more.

![Architecture](img/architecture.png)

### Prowler App

The **Prowler App** consists of three main components:

- **Prowler UI**: A user-friendly web interface for running Prowler and viewing results, powered by Next.js.
- **Prowler API**: The backend API that executes Prowler scans and stores the results, built with Django REST Framework.
- **Prowler SDK**: A Python SDK that integrates with the Prowler CLI for advanced functionality.

The app leverages the following supporting infrastructure:

- **PostgreSQL**: Used for persistent storage of scan results.
- **Celery Workers**: Facilitate asynchronous execution of Prowler scans.
- **Valkey**: An in-memory database serving as a message broker for the Celery workers.

![Prowler App Architecture](img/prowler-app-architecture.png)

## Deprecations from v3

### General
- `Allowlist` now is called `Mutelist`.
- The `--quiet` option has been deprecated, now use the `--status` flag to select the finding's status you want to get from PASS, FAIL or MANUAL.
- All `INFO` finding's status has changed to `MANUAL`.
- The CSV output format is common for all the providers.

We have deprecated some of our outputs formats:

- The native JSON is replaced for the JSON [OCSF](https://schema.ocsf.io/) v1.1.0, common for all the providers.

### AWS
- Deprecate the AWS flag --sts-endpoint-region since we use AWS STS regional tokens.
- To send only FAILS to AWS Security Hub, now use either `--send-sh-only-fails` or `--security-hub --status FAIL`.

## Basic Usage

- **Compliance**: Insights into compliance status. <img src="img/compliance.png" alt="Compliance" width="700"/>

> See more details about the Prowler App usage in the [Prowler App](tutorials/prowler-app.md) section.

???+ note
    Prowler will automatically scan all configured providers every **24 hours**, ensuring your cloud environment stays continuously monitored.

### Prowler CLI

To run Prowler, you will need to specify the provider (e.g `aws`, `gcp`, `azure` or `kubernetes`):

???+ note
    If no provider specified, AWS will be used for backward compatibility with most of v2 options.

```console
prowler <provider>
```
![Prowler Execution](img/short-display.png)

???+ note
    Running the `prowler` command without options will use your environment variable credentials, see [Requirements](./getting-started/requirements.md) section to review the credentials settings.

If you miss the former output you can use `--verbose` but Prowler v4 is smoking fast, so you won't see much ;

By default, Prowler generates CSV, JSON-OCSF and HTML reports. However, you can generate a JSON-ASFF report (used by AWS Security Hub) with `-M` or `--output-modes`:

```console
prowler <provider> -M csv json-asff json-ocsf html
```
The html report will be located in the output directory as the other files and it will look like:

![Prowler Execution](img/html-output.png)

You can use `-l`/`--list-checks` or `--list-services` to list all available checks or services within the provider.

```console
prowler <provider> --list-checks
prowler <provider> --list-services
```

For executing specific checks or services you can use options `-c`/`checks` or `-s`/`services`:

```console
prowler azure --checks storage_blob_public_access_level_is_disabled
prowler aws --services s3 ec2
prowler gcp --services iam compute
prowler kubernetes --services etcd apiserver
```

Also, checks and services can be excluded with options `-e`/`--excluded-checks` or `--excluded-services`:

```console
prowler aws --excluded-checks s3_bucket_public_access
prowler azure --excluded-services defender iam
prowler gcp --excluded-services kms
prowler kubernetes --excluded-services controllermanager
```

More options and executions methods that will save your time in [Miscellaneous](tutorials/misc.md).

You can always use `-h`/`--help` to access to the usage information and all the possible options:

```console
prowler --help
```

#### AWS

Use a custom AWS profile with `-p`/`--profile` and/or AWS regions which you want to audit with `-f`/`--filter-region`:

```console
prowler aws --profile custom-profile -f us-east-1 eu-south-2
```

???+ note
    By default, `prowler` will scan all AWS regions.

See more details about AWS Authentication in [Requirements](getting-started/requirements.md#aws)

#### Azure

With Azure you need to specify which auth method is going to be used:

```console
# To use service principal authentication
prowler azure --sp-env-auth

# To use az cli authentication
prowler azure --az-cli-auth

# To use browser authentication
prowler azure --browser-auth --tenant-id "XXXXXXXX"

# To use managed identity auth
prowler azure --managed-identity-auth
```

See more details about Azure Authentication in [Requirements](getting-started/requirements.md#azure)

Prowler by default scans all the subscriptions that is allowed to scan, if you want to scan a single subscription or various specific subscriptions you can use the following flag (using az cli auth as example):
```console
prowler azure --az-cli-auth --subscription-ids <subscription ID 1> <subscription ID 2> ... <subscription ID N>
```

#### Google Cloud

Prowler will use by default your User Account credentials, you can configure it using:

- `gcloud init` to use a new account
- `gcloud config set account <account>` to use an existing account

Then, obtain your access credentials using: `gcloud auth application-default login`

Otherwise, you can generate and download Service Account keys in JSON format (refer to https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) and provide the location of the file with the following argument:

```console
prowler gcp --credentials-file path
```

Prowler by default scans all the GCP Projects that is allowed to scan, if you want to scan a single project or various specific projects you can use the following flag:
```console
prowler gcp --project-ids <Project ID 1> <Project ID 2> ... <Project ID N>
```

See more details about GCP Authentication in [Requirements](getting-started/requirements.md#google-cloud)

#### Kubernetes

Prowler allows you to scan your Kubernetes Cluster either from within the cluster or from outside the cluster.

For non in-cluster execution, you can provide the location of the KubeConfig file with the following argument:

```console
prowler kubernetes --kubeconfig-file path
```
???+ note
    If no `--kubeconfig-file` is provided, Prowler will use the default KubeConfig file location (`~/.kube/config`).

For in-cluster execution, you can use the supplied yaml to run Prowler as a job within a new Prowler namespace:
```console
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/job.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/prowler-role.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/prowler-rolebinding.yaml
kubectl get pods --namespace prowler-ns --> prowler-XXXXX
kubectl logs prowler-XXXXX --namespace prowler-ns
```

???+ note
    By default, `prowler` will scan all namespaces in your active Kubernetes context. Use the flag `--context` to specify the context to be scanned and `--namespaces` to specify the namespaces to be scanned.
