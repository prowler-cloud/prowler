**Prowler** is an Open Source security tool to perform AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and Kubernetes security best practices assessments, audits, incident response, continuous monitoring, hardening and forensics readiness, and also remediations! We have Prowler CLI (Command Line Interface) that we call Prowler Open Source and a service on top of it that we call <a href="https://prowler.com">Prowler SaaS</a>.

Prowler is available as a project in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/prowler/), thus can be installed using pip with `Python >= 3.9`:

=== "Generic"

    _Requirements_:

    * `Python >= 3.9`
    * `Python pip >= 3.9`
    * AWS, GCP, Azure and/or Kubernetes credentials

    _Commands_:

    ``` bash
    pip install prowler
    prowler -v
    ```

=== "Docker"

    _Requirements_:

    * Have `docker` installed: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/.
    * AWS, GCP, Azure and/or Kubernetes credentials
    * In the command below, change `-v` to your local directory path in order to access the reports.

    ???+ note
        If you want to clone Prowler from Windows, use `git config core.longpaths true` to allow long file paths.

=== "Amazon Linux 2"

    _Requirements_:

    * AWS, GCP, Azure and/or Kubernetes credentials
    * Latest Amazon Linux 2 should come with Python 3.9 already installed however it may need pip. Install Python pip 3.9 with: `sudo yum install -y python3-pip`.
    * Make sure setuptools for python is already installed with: `pip3 install setuptools`

    _Commands_:

    ```
    pip3.9 install prowler

=== "AWS CloudShell"

    After the migration of AWS CloudShell from Amazon Linux 2 to Amazon Linux 2023 [[1]](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/12/aws-cloudshell-migrated-al2023/) [2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/cloudshell-AL2023-migration.html), there is no longer a need to manually compile Python 3.9 as it's already included in AL2023. Prowler can thus be easily installed following the Generic method of installation via pip. Follow the steps below to successfully execute Prowler v4 in AWS CloudShell:

    _Requirements_:

    * Open AWS CloudShell `bash`.

    _Commands_:

    ```
    sudo bash
    adduser prowler
    su prowler
    pip install prowler
    cd /tmp
    prowler aws
    ```

    ???+ note
        To download the results from AWS CloudShell, select Actions -> Download File and add the full path of each file. For the CSV file it will be something like `/tmp/output/prowler-output-123456789012-20221220191331.csv`

=== "Azure CloudShell"

    _Requirements_:

    * Open Azure CloudShell `bash`.

    _Commands_:

    ```
    pip install prowler
    prowler -v
    ```

## Prowler container versions

The available versions of Prowler are the following:

- `latest`: in sync with `master` branch (bear in mind that it is not a stable version)
- `v3-latest`: in sync with `v3` branch (bear in mind that it is not a stable version)
- `<x.y.z>` (release): you can find the releases [here](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/releases), those are stable releases.
- `stable`: this tag always point to the latest release.
- `v3-stable`: this tag always point to the latest release for v3.

The container images are available here:

- [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/toniblyx/prowler/tags)
- [AWS Public ECR](https://gallery.ecr.aws/prowler-cloud/prowler)

## High level architecture

You can run Prowler from your workstation, a Kubernetes Job, a Google Compute Engine, an Azure VM, an EC2 instance, Fargate or any other container, CloudShell and many more.

![Architecture](img/architecture.png)

## Deprecations from v3

### General
- `Allowlist` now is called `Mutelist`.
- The `--quiet` option has been deprecated, now use the `--status` flag to select the finding's status you want to get from PASS, FAIL or MANUAL.
- All `INFO` finding's status has changed to `MANUAL`.
- The CSV output format is common for all the providers.

We have deprecated some of our outputs formats:

- The native JSON is replaced for the JSON [OCSF](https://schema.ocsf.io/) v1.1.0, common for all the providers.

### AWS
- Deprecate the AWS flag --sts-endpoint-region since we use AWS STS regional tokens.
- To send only FAILS to AWS Security Hub, now use either `--send-sh-only-fails` or `--security-hub --status FAIL`.

## Basic Usage

To run Prowler, you will need to specify the provider (e.g `aws`, `gcp`, `azure` or `kubernetes`):

???+ note
    If no provider specified, AWS will be used for backward compatibility with most of v2 options.

```console
prowler <provider>
```
![Prowler Execution](img/short-display.png)

???+ note
    Running the `prowler` command without options will use your environment variable credentials, see [Requirements](./getting-started/requirements.md) section to review the credentials settings.

If you miss the former output you can use `--verbose` but Prowler v4 is smoking fast, so you won't see much ;

By default, Prowler will generate a CSV, JSON and HTML reports, however you can generate a JSON-ASFF (used by AWS Security Hub) report with `-M` or `--output-modes`:

```console
prowler <provider> -M csv json json-asff html
```
The html report will be located in the output directory as the other files and it will look like:

![Prowler Execution](img/html-output.png)

You can use `-l`/`--list-checks` or `--list-services` to list all available checks or services within the provider.

```console
prowler <provider> --list-checks
prowler <provider> --list-services
```

For executing specific checks or services you can use options `-c`/`checks` or `-s`/`services`:

```console
prowler azure --checks storage_blob_public_access_level_is_disabled
prowler aws --services s3 ec2
prowler gcp --services iam compute
prowler kubernetes --services etcd apiserver
```

Also, checks and services can be excluded with options `-e`/`--excluded-checks` or `--excluded-services`:

```console
prowler aws --excluded-checks s3_bucket_public_access
prowler azure --excluded-services defender iam
prowler gcp --excluded-services kms
prowler kubernetes --excluded-services controllermanager
```

More options and executions methods that will save your time in [Miscellaneous](tutorials/misc.md).

You can always use `-h`/`--help` to access to the usage information and all the possible options:

```console
prowler --help
```

### AWS

Use a custom AWS profile with `-p`/`--profile` and/or AWS regions which you want to audit with `-f`/`--filter-region`:

```console
prowler aws --profile custom-profile -f us-east-1 eu-south-2
```

???+ note
    By default, `prowler` will scan all AWS regions.

See more details about AWS Authentication in [Requirements](getting-started/requirements.md#aws)

### Azure

With Azure you need to specify which auth method is going to be used:

```console
# To use service principal authentication
prowler azure --sp-env-auth

# To use az cli authentication
prowler azure --az-cli-auth

# To use browser authentication
prowler azure --browser-auth --tenant-id "XXXXXXXX"

# To use managed identity auth
prowler azure --managed-identity-auth
```

See more details about Azure Authentication in [Requirements](getting-started/requirements.md#azure)

Prowler by default scans all the subscriptions that is allowed to scan, if you want to scan a single subscription or various specific subscriptions you can use the following flag (using az cli auth as example):
```console
prowler azure --az-cli-auth --subscription-ids <subscription ID 1> <subscription ID 2> ... <subscription ID N>
```

### Google Cloud

Prowler will use by default your User Account credentials, you can configure it using:

- `gcloud init` to use a new account
- `gcloud config set account <account>` to use an existing account

Then, obtain your access credentials using: `gcloud auth application-default login`

Otherwise, you can generate and download Service Account keys in JSON format (refer to https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) and provide the location of the file with the following argument:

```console
prowler gcp --credentials-file path
```

Prowler by default scans all the GCP Projects that is allowed to scan, if you want to scan a single project or various specific projects you can use the following flag:
```console
prowler gcp --project-ids <Project ID 1> <Project ID 2> ... <Project ID N>
```

See more details about GCP Authentication in [Requirements](getting-started/requirements.md#google-cloud)

### Kubernetes

Prowler allows you to scan your Kubernetes Cluster either from within the cluster or from outside the cluster.

For non in-cluster execution, you can provide the location of the KubeConfig file with the following argument:

```console
prowler kubernetes --kubeconfig-file path
```
???+ note
    If no `--kubeconfig-file` is provided, Prowler will use the default KubeConfig file location (`~/.kube/config`).

For in-cluster execution, you can use the supplied yaml to run Prowler as a job within a new Prowler namespace:
```console
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/job.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/prowler-role.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/prowler-rolebinding.yaml
kubectl get pods --namespace prowler-ns --> prowler-XXXXX
kubectl logs prowler-XXXXX --namespace prowler-ns
```

???+ note
    By default, `prowler` will scan all namespaces in your active Kubernetes context. Use the flag `--context` to specify the context to be scanned and `--namespaces` to specify the namespaces to be scanned.
