Prowler can thus be easily installed following the generic method of installation via pip. Follow the steps below to successfully execute Prowler v4 in AWS CloudShell:

    _Requirements_:

    * Open AWS CloudShell `bash`.

    _Commands_:

    ```bash
    sudo bash
    adduser prowler
    su prowler
    python3 -m pip install --user pipx
    python3 -m pipx ensurepath
    pipx install prowler
    cd /tmp
    prowler aws
    ```

    ???+ note
        To download the results from AWS CloudShell, select Actions -> Download File and add the full path of each file. For the CSV file it will be something like `/tmp/output/prowler-output-123456789012-20221220191331.csv`

=== "Azure CloudShell"

    _Requirements_:

    * Open Azure CloudShell `bash`.

    _Commands_:

    ```bash

    cd /tmp
    prowler azure --az-cli-auth
    ```

### Prowler App Update

You have two options to upgrade your Prowler App installation:

#### Option 1: Change env file with the following values

Edit your `.env` file and change the version values:

```env
PROWLER_UI_VERSION="5.9.0"
PROWLER_API_VERSION="5.9.0"
```

#### Option 2: Run the following command

```bash
docker compose pull --policy always
```

The `--policy always` flag ensures that Docker pulls the latest images even if they already exist locally.


???+ note "What Gets Preserved During Upgrade"

    Everything is preserved, nothing will be deleted after the update.

#### Troubleshooting

If containers don't start, check logs for errors:

```bash
# Check logs for errors
docker compose logs

# Verify image versions
docker images | grep prowler
```

If you encounter issues, you can rollback to the previous version by changing the `.env` file back to your previous version and running:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

## Prowler container versions

## High level architecture

You can run Prowler from your workstation, a Kubernetes Job, a Google Compute Engine, an Azure VM, an EC2 instance, Fargate or any other container, CloudShell and many more.

![Architecture](img/architecture.png)

### Prowler App

The **Prowler App** consists of three main components:

- **Prowler UI**: A user-friendly web interface for running Prowler and viewing results, powered by Next.js.
- **Prowler API**: The backend API that executes Prowler scans and stores the results, built with Django REST Framework.
- **Prowler SDK**: A Python SDK that integrates with Prowler CLI for advanced functionality.

The app leverages the following supporting infrastructure:

- **PostgreSQL**: Used for persistent storage of scan results.
- **Celery Workers**: Facilitate asynchronous execution of Prowler scans.
- **Valkey**: An in-memory database serving as a message broker for the Celery workers.

![Prowler App Architecture](img/prowler-app-architecture.png)

## Deprecations from v3

The following are the deprecations carried out from v3.

### General

- `Allowlist` now is called `Mutelist`.
- The `--quiet` option has been deprecated. From now on use the `--status` flag to select the finding's status you want to get: PASS, FAIL or MANUAL.
- All `INFO` finding's status has changed to `MANUAL`.
- The CSV output format is common for all providers.

Some output formats are now deprecated:

- The native JSON is replaced for the JSON [OCSF](https://schema.ocsf.io/) v1.1.0, common for all the providers.

### AWS
- Deprecate the AWS flag `--sts-endpoint-region` since AWS STS regional tokens are used.
- To send only FAILS to AWS Security Hub, now you must use either `--send-sh-only-fails` or `--security-hub --status FAIL`.

## Basic Usage

### Prowler App

#### **Access the App**

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) after installing the app (see [Quick Start](#prowler-app-installation)). Sign up with your email and password.

<img src="img/sign-up-button.png" alt="Sign Up Button" width="320"/>
<img src="img/sign-up.png" alt="Sign Up" width="285"/>

???+ note "User creation and default tenant behavior"

    When creating a new user, the behavior depends on whether an invitation is provided:

    - **Without an invitation**:

        - A new tenant is automatically created.
        - The new user is assigned to this tenant.
        - A set of **RBAC admin permissions** is generated and assigned to the user for the newly-created tenant.

    - **With an invitation**: The user is added to the specified tenant with the permissions defined in the invitation.

    This mechanism ensures that the first user in a newly created tenant has administrative permissions within that tenant.

#### Log In

Log in using your **email and password** to access the Prowler App.

<img src="img/log-in.png" alt="Log In" width="285"/>

#### Add a Cloud Provider

To configure a cloud provider for scanning:

1. Navigate to `Settings > Cloud Providers` and click `Add Account`.
2. Select the cloud provider you wish to scan (**AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes**).
3. Enter the provider's identifier (Optional: Add an alias):
    - **AWS**: Account ID
    - **GCP**: Project ID
    - **Azure**: Subscription ID
    - **Kubernetes**: Cluster ID
    - **M36**: Domain ID
4. Follow the guided instructions to add and authenticate your credentials.

#### Start a Scan

Once credentials are successfully added and validated, Prowler initiates a scan of your cloud environment.

Click `Go to Scans` to monitor progress.

#### View Results

While the scan is running, you can review findings in the following sections:

- **Overview** – Provides a high-level summary of your scans.
  <img src="img/overview.png" alt="Overview" width="700"/>

- **Compliance** – Displays compliance insights based on security frameworks.
  <img src="img/compliance.png" alt="Compliance" width="700"/>

> For detailed usage instructions, refer to the [Prowler App Guide](tutorials/prowler-app.md).

???+ note
    Prowler will automatically scan all configured providers every **24 hours**, ensuring your cloud environment stays continuously monitored.

### Prowler CLI

#### Running Prowler

To run Prowler, you will need to specify the provider (e.g `aws`, `gcp`, `azure`, `m365`, `github` or `kubernetes`):

???+ note
    If no provider is specified, AWS is used by default for backward compatibility with Prowler v2.

```console
prowler <provider>
```
![Prowler Execution](img/short-display.png)

???+ note
    Running the `prowler` command without options will uses environment variable credentials. Refer to the [Requirements](./getting-started/requirements.md) section for credential configuration details.

#### Verbose Output

If you prefer the former verbose output, use: `--verbose`. This allows seeing more info while Prowler is running, minimal output is displayed unless verbosity is enabled.

#### Report Generation

By default, Prowler generates CSV, JSON-OCSF, and HTML reports. To generate a JSON-ASFF report (used by AWS Security Hub), specify `-M` or `--output-modes`:

```console
prowler <provider> -M csv json-asff json-ocsf html
```
The HTML report is saved in the output directory, alongside other reports. It will look like this:

![Prowler Execution](img/html-output.png)

#### Listing Available Checks and Services

To view all available checks or services within a provider:, use `-l`/`--list-checks` or `--list-services`.

```console
prowler <provider> --list-checks
prowler <provider> --list-services
```
#### Running Specific Checks or Services

Execute specific checks or services using `-c`/`checks` or `-s`/`services`:

```console
prowler azure --checks storage_blob_public_access_level_is_disabled
prowler aws --services s3 ec2
prowler gcp --services iam compute
prowler kubernetes --services etcd apiserver
```
#### Excluding Checks and Services

Checks and services can be excluded with `-e`/`--excluded-checks` or `--excluded-services`:

```console
prowler aws --excluded-checks s3_bucket_public_access
prowler azure --excluded-services defender iam
prowler gcp --excluded-services kms
prowler kubernetes --excluded-services controllermanager
```
#### Additional Options

Explore more advanced time-saving execution methods in the [Miscellaneous](tutorials/misc.md) section.

To access the help menu and view all available options, use: `-h`/`--help`:

```console
prowler --help
```

#### AWS

Use a custom AWS profile with `-p`/`--profile` and/or the AWS regions you want to audit with `-f`/`--filter-region`:

```console
prowler aws --profile custom-profile -f us-east-1 eu-south-2
```

???+ note
    By default, `prowler` will scan all AWS regions.

See more details about AWS Authentication in the [Requirements](getting-started/requirements.md#aws) section.

#### Azure

Azure requires specifying the auth method:

```console
# To use service principal authentication
prowler azure --sp-env-auth

# To use az cli authentication
prowler azure --az-cli-auth

# To use browser authentication
prowler azure --browser-auth --tenant-id "XXXXXXXX"

# To use managed identity auth
prowler azure --managed-identity-auth
```

See more details about Azure Authentication in [Requirements](getting-started/requirements.md#azure)

By default, Prowler scans all the subscriptions for which it has permissions. To scan a single or various specific subscription you can use the following flag (using az cli auth as example):

```console
prowler azure --az-cli-auth --subscription-ids <subscription ID 1> <subscription ID 2> ... <subscription ID N>
```
#### Google Cloud

- **User Account Credentials**

    By default, Prowler uses **User Account credentials**. You can configure your account using:

    - `gcloud init` – Set up a new account.
    - `gcloud config set account <account>` – Switch to an existing account.

    Once configured, obtain access credentials using: `gcloud auth application-default login`.

- **Service Account Authentication**

    Alternatively, you can use Service Account credentials:

    Generate and download Service Account keys in JSON format. Refer to [Google IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) for details.

    Provide the key file location using this argument:

    ```console
    prowler gcp --credentials-file path
    ```

- **Scanning Specific GCP Projects**

    By default, Prowler scans all accessible GCP projects. To scan specific projects, use the `--project-ids` flag:

    ```console
    prowler gcp --project-ids <Project ID 1> <Project ID 2> ... <Project ID N>
    ```

- **GCP Retry Configuration**

    To configure the maximum number of retry attempts for Google Cloud SDK API calls, use the `--gcp-retries-max-attempts` flag:

    ```console
    prowler gcp --gcp-retries-max-attempts 5
    ```

    This is useful when experiencing quota exceeded errors (HTTP 429) to increase the number of automatic retry attempts.

#### Kubernetes

Prowler enables security scanning of Kubernetes clusters, supporting both **in-cluster** and **external** execution.

- **Non In-Cluster Execution**

    ```console
    prowler kubernetes --kubeconfig-file path
    ```
    ???+ note
        If no `--kubeconfig-file` is provided, Prowler will use the default KubeConfig file location (`~/.kube/config`).

- **In-Cluster Execution**

    To run Prowler inside the cluster, apply the provided YAML configuration to deploy a job in a new namespace:

    ```console
    kubectl apply -f kubernetes/prowler-sa.yaml
    kubectl apply -f kubernetes/job.yaml
    kubectl apply -f kubernetes/prowler-role.yaml
    kubectl apply -f kubernetes/prowler-rolebinding.yaml
    kubectl get pods --namespace prowler-ns --> prowler-XXXXX
    kubectl logs prowler-XXXXX --namespace prowler-ns
    ```

    ???+ note
        By default, Prowler scans all namespaces in the active Kubernetes context. Use the `--context`flag to specify the context to be scanned and `--namespaces` to restrict scanning to specific namespaces.

#### Microsoft 365

Microsoft 365 requires specifying the auth method:

```console

# To use service principal authentication for MSGraph and PowerShell modules
prowler m365 --sp-env-auth

# To use both service principal (for MSGraph) and user credentials (for PowerShell modules)
prowler m365 --env-auth

# To use az cli authentication
prowler m365 --az-cli-auth

# To use browser authentication
prowler m365 --browser-auth --tenant-id "XXXXXXXX"

```

See more details about M365 Authentication in the [Requirements](getting-started/requirements.md#microsoft-365) section.

#### GitHub

Prowler enables security scanning of your **GitHub account**, including **Repositories**, **Organizations** and **Applications**.

- **Supported Authentication Methods**

    Authenticate using one of the following methods:

    ```console
    # Personal Access Token (PAT):
    prowler github --personal-access-token pat

    # OAuth App Token:
    prowler github --oauth-app-token oauth_token

    # GitHub App Credentials:
    prowler github --github-app-id app_id --github-app-key app_key
    ```

    ???+ note
        If no login method is explicitly provided, Prowler will automatically attempt to authenticate using environment variables in the following order of precedence:

        1. `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
        2. `OAUTH_APP_TOKEN`
        3. `GITHUB_APP_ID` and `GITHUB_APP_KEY`

#### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Prowler's Infrastructure as Code (IaC) provider enables you to scan local or remote infrastructure code for security and compliance issues using [Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/). This provider supports a wide range of IaC frameworks, allowing you to assess your code before deployment.

```console
# Scan a directory for IaC files
prowler iac --scan-path ./my-iac-directory

# Scan a remote GitHub repository (public or private)
prowler iac --scan-repository-url https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Authenticate to a private repo with GitHub username and PAT
prowler iac --scan-repository-url https://github.com/user/repo.git \
  --github-username <username> --personal-access-token <token>

# Authenticate to a private repo with OAuth App Token
prowler iac --scan-repository-url https://github.com/user/repo.git \
  --oauth-app-token <oauth_token>

# Specify frameworks to scan (default: all)
prowler iac --scan-path ./my-iac-directory --frameworks terraform kubernetes

# Exclude specific paths
prowler iac --scan-path ./my-iac-directory --exclude-path ./my-iac-directory/test,./my-iac-directory/examples
```

???+ note
    - `--scan-path` and `--scan-repository-url` are mutually exclusive; only one can be specified at a time.
    - For remote repository scans, authentication can be provided via CLI flags or environment variables (`GITHUB_OAUTH_APP_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_USERNAME`, `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`). CLI flags take precedence.
    - The IaC provider does not require cloud authentication for local scans.
    - It is ideal for CI/CD pipelines and local development environments.
    - For more details on supported frameworks and rules, see the [Checkov documentation](https://www.checkov.io/1.Welcome/Quick%20Start.html)

See more details about IaC scanning in the [IaC Tutorial](tutorials/iac/getting-started-iac.md) section.
