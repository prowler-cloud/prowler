## Egress IP Addresses

Prowler Cloud makes outbound API calls to scan cloud provider accounts and connect to integrations. Allowlist these IPs in firewalls or security groups to restrict access to Prowler Cloud only.

| Region | IP Address |
|--------|------------|
| EU (Ireland) | `52.48.254.174` |

Resolve the egress IP via DNS:

```bash
dig egress.prowler.com +short
```
