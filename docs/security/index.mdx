**Prowler secures itself with Prowler.** As an open-source cloud security platform trusted by thousands of organizations, Prowler applies the same rigorous security standards internally that customers achieve externally.

All security tooling, configurations, and CI/CD pipelines are publicly available in the [Prowler GitHub repository](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler). Transparency is fundamental to open-source security.

## Software Security

All Prowler code goes through the same security pipeline, whether running on Prowler Cloud or self-managed infrastructure: DAST, SAST, SCA, container scanning, and secrets detection on every build.

## Prowler Cloud vs Self-Managed

| | Prowler Cloud | Self-Managed |
|--|---------------|--------------|
| **Deployment** | Fully managed SaaS | Own infrastructure |
| **Region** | EU (Ireland) | Any region or provider |
| **Compliance** | SOC 2 Type II, AWS FTR | Organization responsibility |
| **Data Control** | Prowler managed | Full control |
| **Encryption** | AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.2+ in transit | Configurable |
| **Backups** | Automated | Organization responsibility |
| **Updates** | Automatic | Manual |

<Note>
Self-Managed includes Prowler App and Prowler CLI. They can run anywhere — any cloud provider, any region, on-premises, or air-gapped environments. Full control over data residency and infrastructure decisions. See the [Prowler App Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation/prowler-app) to get started.
