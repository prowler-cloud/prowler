title: 'AWS Security Hub'
---

AWS Security Hub remains a managed service designed for centralizing security alerts and compliance status within AWS environments. It integrates with various AWS security services and provides a consolidated view of security findings.

## Key Features and Strengths

- **Centralized Dashboard for AWS:** Provides a single pane of glass to monitor and manage security findings from multiple AWS services like GuardDuty, Inspector, and Config.

- **Compliance Checks:** Automatically checks for compliance against standards like CIS and PCI DSS within AWS environments.

- **AWS Native Automation:** Offers seamless automation for incident response using AWS Lambda and CloudWatch Events, reducing the time to react to security issues.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Accessible via the AWS Management Console, offering a streamlined experience for managing security across AWS accounts.

## Limitations

- **AWS-Centric:** Limited to AWS environments, with no direct support for multi-cloud or hybrid environments.

- **Dependency on AWS Config:** Some of its checks depend on AWS Config, which may not be enabled in all regions or accounts.

- **Vendor Lock-In:** Tightly coupled with AWS, making it less suitable for organizations with a cloud-agnostic strategy.

## Prowler

Prowler is an open-source, multi-cloud security tool that offers extensive customization and flexibility, making it ideal for organizations with complex or multi-cloud environments. Here are the updated features and advantages:

## Main Advantages of Prowler

- **Multi-Region and Multi-Account Scanning by Default:**
  - Prowler is inherently multi-region and can scan multiple AWS accounts without requiring additional configuration or enabling specific services like AWS Config.

- **Minimal Setup Requirements:**
  - All Prowler needs is a role with appropriate permissions to start scanning. There’s no need to enable specific services or configure complex setups.

- **Versatile Execution Environment:**
  - Prowler can be run from various environments, including a local workstation, container, AWS CloudShell, or even from another AWS account or cloud provider by assuming a role. This flexibility makes it easy to integrate into different operational workflows.

- **Flexible Results Storage and Sharing:**
  - Prowler results can be stored directly into an S3 bucket, allowing for quick analysis, or locally for easy sharing and discussion. This flexibility is particularly useful for collaborative security assessments.

- **Customizable Reporting and Analysis:**
  - Prowler supports exporting results in multiple formats, including JSON, CSV, OCSF format, and static HTML reports. It also supports integration with Amazon QuickSight for in-depth analysis and offers a SaaS model with resource-based pricing, making it adaptable to different organizational needs.

- **Security Hub Integration for Cost-Effective Operations:**
  - Prowler can send results directly into Security Hub in any AWS account, including only failed findings. This selective reporting can make Security Hub more cost-effective by reducing the volume of data processed.

- **Custom Checks and Compliance Frameworks:**
  - Users can write custom checks, remediations, and compliance frameworks in minutes, tailoring the tool to their specific security policies and operational needs.

- **Extensive Compliance Support:**
  - Prowler supports over 27 compliance frameworks out of the box for AWS, providing comprehensive coverage across various regulatory requirements and best practices.

- **Kubernetes and Multi-Cloud Support:**
  - Prowler extends its scanning capabilities beyond AWS, offering support for Kubernetes clusters (including EKS), as well as environments in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Azure. This multi-cloud capability is essential for organizations with diverse cloud footprints.

- **All-Region Checks:**
  - Prowler runs all checks in all regions, regardless of AWS Config resource type support, ensuring comprehensive coverage across your entire AWS environment.

## Comparison Summary

### Scope and Environment

- **Security Hub** is ideal for AWS-centric environments needing a managed service for monitoring and automating security across AWS resources.
- **Prowler** is better suited for organizations operating in multi-cloud or hybrid environments, offering flexibility, customization, and support for multiple cloud providers including AWS, Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes.

### Setup and Maintenance

- **Security Hub** requires enabling and configuring AWS services by region, per account, and can become more than one person's full-time role – including Config. Security Hub operates only within the AWS ecosystem.
- **Prowler** requires minimal setup, only needing appropriate permissions, and can be executed from various environments, making it more versatile in different operational contexts.

### Customization and Flexibility

- **Security Hub** offers predefined compliance checks and automation within AWS but is less flexible in terms of customization.
- **Prowler** allows for highly customizable checks, remediation actions, and compliance frameworks, with the ability to adapt quickly to organizational needs and regulatory changes.

### Cost Efficiency

- **Security Hub** may involve additional costs for processing and storing findings.
- **Prowler** can optimize costs by selectively sending failed findings to Security Hub and storing results locally or in S3, which can be more cost-effective.

### Multi-Cloud and Multi-Region Support

- **Security Hub** is confined to AWS, with region-specific checks depending on AWS Config.
- **Prowler** is inherently multi-region and multi-cloud, offering consistent and comprehensive checks across different cloud environments and regions.

## Conclusion

For a CISO or security professional evaluating these tools, the decision between AWS Security Hub and Prowler will depend on the organization’s cloud strategy, compliance needs, and the level of flexibility required:

- If the organization is heavily invested in AWS and prefers a managed, integrated security service that offers ease of use and automation within the AWS ecosystem, **AWS Security Hub** is the more appropriate choice.

- If the organization operates in a multi-cloud environment or requires a highly customizable tool that can run comprehensive, multi-region scans across AWS, Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes, **Prowler** provides a more powerful and flexible solution, especially for those needing to adapt quickly to evolving security and compliance requirements.
