### Updating Prowler App

Upgrade Prowler App installation using one of two options:

#### Option 1: Updating the Environment File

To update the environment file:

Edit the `.env` file and change version values:

```env
PROWLER_UI_VERSION="5.18.0"
PROWLER_API_VERSION="5.18.0"
```

<Note>
  You can find the latest versions of Prowler App in the [Releases Github section](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/releases) or in the [Container Versions](#container-versions) section of this documentation.
</Note>


#### Option 2: Using Docker Compose Pull

```bash
docker compose pull --policy always
```

The `--policy always` flag ensures that Docker pulls the latest images even if they already exist locally.

<Note>
  **What Gets Preserved During Upgrade**

  Everything is preserved, nothing will be deleted after the update.
</Note>

### Troubleshooting Installation Issues

If containers don't start, check logs for errors:

```bash
# Check logs for errors
docker compose logs

# Verify image versions
docker images | grep prowler
```

If issues are encountered, rollback to the previous version by changing the `.env` file back to the previous version and running:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```
