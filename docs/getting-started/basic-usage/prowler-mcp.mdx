Configure your MCP client to connect to Prowler MCP Server.

## Step 1: Get Your API Key (Optional)

<Note>
**Authentication is optional**: Prowler Hub and Prowler Documentation features work without authentication. An API key is only required for Prowler Cloud and Prowler App (Self-Managed) features.
</Note>

To use Prowler Cloud or Prowler App (Self-Managed) features. To get the API key, please refer to the [API Keys](/user-guide/providers/prowler-app-api-keys) guide.

<Warning>
Keep the API key secure. Never share it publicly or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Configure Your MCP Client

Choose the configuration based on your deployment:

- **STDIO Mode**: Local installation only (runs as subprocess).
- **HTTP Mode**: Prowler Cloud MCP Server or self-hosted Prowler MCP Server.

### HTTP Mode (Prowler Cloud MCP Server or self-hosted Prowler MCP Server)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Native HTTP Support (Cursor, VSCode)">
    **Clients that support HTTP with custom headers natively**

    For example: Cursor, VSCode, LobeChat, etc.

    **Configuration:**
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "prowler": {
          "url": "https://mcp.prowler.com/mcp", // or your self-hosted Prowler MCP Server URL
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer pk_your_api_key_here"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Using mcp-remote (Claude Desktop)">
    **For clients without native HTTP support (like Claude Desktop)**

    For example: Claude Desktop.

    **Configuration:**
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "prowler": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "mcp-remote",
            "https://mcp.prowler.com/mcp", // or your self-hosted Prowler MCP Server URL
            "--header",
            "Authorization: Bearer ${PROWLER_APP_API_KEY}"
          ],
          "env": {
            "PROWLER_APP_API_KEY": "pk_your_api_key_here"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    <Info>
    The `mcp-remote` tool acts as a bridge for clients that don't support HTTP natively. Learn more at [mcp-remote on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote).

### STDIO Mode (Local Installation Only)

STDIO mode is only available when running the MCP server locally.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using uvx">
    **Run from source or local installation**

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "prowler": {
          "command": "uvx",
          "args": ["/absolute/path/to/prowler/mcp_server/"],
          "env": {
            "PROWLER_APP_API_KEY": "pk_your_api_key_here",
            "PROWLER_API_BASE_URL": "https://api.prowler.com"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    <Note>
    Replace `/absolute/path/to/prowler/mcp_server/` with the actual path. The `PROWLER_API_BASE_URL` is optional and defaults to Prowler Cloud API.
    </Note>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Using Docker">
    **Run with Docker image**

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "prowler": {
          "command": "docker",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "--rm",
            "-i",
            "--env",
            "PROWLER_APP_API_KEY=pk_your_api_key_here",
            "--env",
            "PROWLER_API_BASE_URL=https://api.prowler.com",
            "prowlercloud/prowler-mcp"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    <Note>
    The `PROWLER_API_BASE_URL` is optional and defaults to Prowler Cloud API.
    </Note>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Start Using Prowler MCP

Restart your MCP client and start asking questions:
- *"Show me all critical findings from my AWS accounts"*
- *"What does the S3 bucket public access check do?"*
- *"Onboard this new AWS account in my Prowler Organization"*

## Authentication Methods

Prowler MCP Server supports two authentication methods to connect to Prowler Cloud or Prowler App (Self-Managed):

### API Key (Recommended)

Use your Prowler API key directly in the Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer pk_your_api_key_here
```

This is the recommended method for most users.

### JWT Token

Alternatively, obtain a JWT token from Prowler:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.prowler.com/api/v1/tokens \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" \
  -d '{
    "data": {
      "type": "tokens",
      "attributes": {
        "email": "your-email@example.com",
        "password": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }'
```

Use the returned JWT token in place of the API key:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
```

<Warning>
JWT tokens are only valid for 30 minutes. You need to generate a new token if you want to continue using the MCP server.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Detected

- Restart your MCP client after configuration changes
- Check the configuration file syntax (valid JSON)
- Review client logs for specific error messages
- Verify the server URL is correct

### Authentication Failures

**Error: Unauthorized (401)**
- Verify your API key is correct
- Ensure the key hasn't expired
- Check you're using the right API endpoint

### Connection Issues

**Cannot Reach Server:**
- Verify the server URL is correct
- Check network connectivity
- For local servers, ensure the server is running
- Check firewall settings

## Security Best Practices

1. **Protect Your API Key**
   - Never commit API keys to version control.
   - Use environment variables or secure vaults.
   - Rotate keys regularly.

2. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS for production deployments.
   - Restrict network access to the MCP server.
   - Consider VPN for remote access.

3. **Least Privilege**
   - API key gives the permission of the user who created the key, make sure to use the key with the minimal required permissions.
   - Review the tools that are gonna be used and how they are gonna be used to avoid prompt injections or unintended behavior.
