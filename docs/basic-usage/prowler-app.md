???+ note "User creation and default tenant behavior"

    When creating a new user, the behavior depends on whether an invitation is provided:

    - **Without an invitation**:

        - A new tenant is automatically created.
        - The new user is assigned to this tenant.
        - A set of **RBAC admin permissions** is generated and assigned to the user for the newly-created tenant.

    - **With an invitation**: The user is added to the specified tenant with the permissions defined in the invitation.

    This mechanism ensures that the first user in a newly created tenant has administrative permissions within that tenant.
