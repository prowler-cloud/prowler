    ???+ warning
        Google and GitHub authentication is only available in [Prowler Cloud](https://prowler.com).

=== "GitHub"

    _Requirements_:

    * `git` installed.
    * `poetry` installed: [poetry installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
    * `npm` installed: [npm installation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
    * `Docker Compose` installed: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/.

    ???+ warning
        Make sure to have `api/.env` and `ui/.env.local` files with the required environment variables. You can find the required environment variables in the [`api/.env.template`](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/blob/master/api/.env.example) and [`ui/.env.template`](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/blob/master/ui/.env.template) files.

    _Commands to run the API_:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler \
    cd prowler/api \
    poetry install \
    eval $(poetry env activate) \
    set -a \
    source .env \
    docker compose up postgres valkey -d \
    cd src/backend \
    python manage.py migrate --database admin \
    gunicorn -c config/guniconf.py config.wsgi:application
    ```

    ???+ important
        Starting from Poetry v2.0.0, `poetry shell` has been deprecated in favor of `poetry env activate`.

        If your poetry version is below 2.0.0 you must keep using `poetry shell` to activate your environment.
        In case you have any doubts, consult the Poetry environment activation guide: https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/#activating-the-environment

    > Now, you can access the API documentation at http://localhost:8080/api/v1/docs.

### Update Prowler App

Upgrade Prowler App installation using one of two options:

#### Option 1: Update Environment File

Edit the `.env` file and change version values:

```env
PROWLER_UI_VERSION="5.9.0"
PROWLER_API_VERSION="5.9.0"
```

#### Option 2: Use Docker Compose Pull

```bash
docker compose pull --policy always
```

The `--policy always` flag ensures that Docker pulls the latest images even if they already exist locally.


???+ note "What Gets Preserved During Upgrade"
    Everything is preserved, nothing will be deleted after the update.

### Troubleshooting

If containers don't start, check logs for errors:

```bash
# Check logs for errors
docker compose logs

# Verify image versions
docker images | grep prowler
```

If you encounter issues, you can rollback to the previous version by changing the `.env` file back to your previous version and running:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```
